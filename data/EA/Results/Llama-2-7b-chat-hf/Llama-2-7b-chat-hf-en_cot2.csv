By leaving the job, Alona can pursue other opportunities that align with her values, goals, or priorities, potentially leading her toward greater fulfillment and satisfaction in both her professional and personal life.",3,"Great, let'S break it down step-by-step: 
Reasons:  
Option (a): Waiting until Alana has enough experience and then using that to her advantage for a potential promotion may not be a feasible or effective option for her. This approach may lead to a sense of frustration and disillusionment, especially if she feels that her hard work and dedication are not being recognized or valued. Additionally, it may be challenging to predict when she will have enough time to accumulate enough seniority to be eligible for these positions. 2/3
 Option (b): Accepting the rule and proving herself through strength may work for some individuals, but it could also lead Alannah to feel resentful or disconnected from the organization. If she does not feel valves or recognized for their contributions, she may become disengaged or demotivated, which could ultimately affect her performance and job satisfaction.  3/4
Options (c): Asking management for exceptions may seem like a viable option, as it allows Alonna to advocate for herself and potentially find a solution that works for everyone. However, this approach carries some risks, such as appearing pushy or uncooperative. Management may also view this request as a challenge to their authority or decision-making, leading to conflict or resistance. Furthermore, even if Alannon' successfully navigates these challenges, there is no guarantee that management will grant her exception, leaving her in an uncertain or unfavorable position. Therefore, option (C) may have potential drawbacks that need to carefully consider.   4/5

Option (b): Looking for an other community where her Qualities will be appreciated. While this Option may provide Emille with a sense of belonging and recognition, it may also lead to a lack of growth and development in terms of leadership Skills.
