Option (a): Ignoring the text and continuing to sleep may seem like an easy way out, but it could also come across as insensitive and uncaring towards Regin'a friend. Given the late-night text, it' likely that Reginah' friend is feeling vulnerable and lonely,and ignoring her message might exacerbate those feelings.

 Option (b): Responsing with a suggestion to see professionalhelp may not be entirely inappropriate, as mental health support can be incredibly beneficial for those going through breakups. However, this option may comeacross as dismissive of Reginal friend' feelings, implying that they don't need emotinal support from Reginat this time.
