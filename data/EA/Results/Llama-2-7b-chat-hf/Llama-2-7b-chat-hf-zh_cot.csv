"['告诉他的父亲他完全错了', '通过努力在新工作中取得成功来证明他错了', '想想新工作的积极方面', '忽略他父亲的评论']",1,"Great! Let's analyze the situation and determine the most effective action for Jared.
Based on the information provided, we know that Jered has worked in the same industry for a while but is now excited about finding a job in a different field. His father has mentioned that he thinks Jerd can only work for six months in this new field, which seems to be a limiting belief. As a result, Jere'ts motivation and confidence in his abilities may be affected by this belief, and he may feel uncertain about his future in that field .
Now, let' s evaluate each option and predict how Jareld might react: 
Option (a): Telling his father he is completely wrong.  This option may not be the best choice for several reasons: First, it may lead to an argument or conflict between Jaded and hisfather, rather than a productive conversation. Second, It may reinforce Jard'ss father' belief thatJared canonly work in one field forsix months, making him even more hesitant to explore new opportunities. Finally, this approach may come across as defensive and unopen-minded, potentially damaging Jad'e relationship with his parent. Therefore, option ( a) is not themost effectiveaction forJered.  
 Option (b): Proving himself through hard work and success in new job. This approach could be more effective for two reasons : Firstly, by focusing on his efforts and achievements inthe newfield,Jareid can demonstrate his capabilities and potential to his Father, gradually changing his limit ing belief . Secondly , by succeeding inhis new role, Jered can build his confidence and motivat ion, helping him overcome his fear of failure and pursue his goals with renewed enthusiasm. However, there is a risk that hisFather may still be skeptical or unconvinced, especially if he has a fixed mindset or lacks exposure to new ideas. So, while option( b) has potential,it maynot be enough to completely shift his Fathers beliefs.   
 option  (c): Thinking positively about the new work'a aspects. While this option could help Jade shifthis focus away from his fathers limitings belief and towards the potential of thenew field , it might not address the underlying issue directly. Jader' father",2,"Great! Let's analyze the situation and determine the most effective action for Jared.
Based on the information provided, we know that Jered has worked in the same industry for a while but is now excited about finding a job in a different field. His father has mentioned that he thinks Jerd can only work for six months in this new field, which seems to be a limiting belief. As a result, Jere'ts motivation and confidence in his abilities may be affected by this belief, and he may feel uncertain about his future in that field .
Now, let' s evaluate each option and predict how Jareld might react: 
Option (a): Telling his father he is completely wrong.  This option may not be the best choice for several reasons: First, it may lead to an argument or conflict between Jaded and hisfather, rather than a productive conversation. Second, It may reinforce Jard'ss father' belief thatJared canonly work in one field forsix months, making him even more hesitant to explore new opportunities. Finally, this approach may come across as defensive and unopen-minded, potentially damaging Jad'e relationship with his parent. Therefore, option ( a) is not themost effectiveaction forJered.  
 Option (b): Proving himself through hard work and success in new job. This approach could be more effective for two reasons : Firstly, by focusing on his efforts and achievements inthe newfield,Jareid can demonstrate his capabilities and potential to his Father, gradually changing his limit ing belief . Secondly , by succeeding inhis new role, Jered can build his confidence and motivat ion, helping him overcome his fear of failure and pursue his goals with renewed enthusiasm. However, there is a risk that hisFather may still be skeptical or unconvinced, especially if he has a fixed mindset or lacks exposure to new ideas. So, while option( b) has potential,it maynot be enough to completely shift his Fathers beliefs.
