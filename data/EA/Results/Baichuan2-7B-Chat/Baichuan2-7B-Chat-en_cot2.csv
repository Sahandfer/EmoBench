This means that they have an agreement where the sister-in-law will take care of Mina's children in return for some compensation. The sister-in-law also cleans up the house, which may be something extra or not part of their agreement.
Mina does not like it when the sister-in-law comments on the mess. This may make her feel uncomfortable and offended.

She can do this by choosing option (a): telling her sister-in-law these comments upset her.",0,"The sister-in-law regularly baby-sits for her for a small fee.

It seems that there is a contradiction between her actions and words, so we should choose an action that can solve this contradiction.
From the choices, we can see that (a), (b), and (d) are not effective because they cannot solve the contradiction between her actions and words. Only choice (c) can tell her only to baby-sit but not to clean, which can solve the problem effectively.

Option (c) sounds like a bad idea because it could lead to more conflict. Option (d) is also a bad idea because it would be disrespectful to the sister-in-law.
Option (a) seems like the best option because it would let Mina express her feelings without breaking their agreement or causing more conflict. It would also show respect for their relationship because it would let them work through their issues instead of just cutting each other off.",0,"The sister-in-law regularly baby-sits for her for a small fee.
