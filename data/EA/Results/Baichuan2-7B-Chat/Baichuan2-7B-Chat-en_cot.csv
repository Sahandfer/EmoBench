"['Promise to keep the secret', 'Inform their parents anyway', 'Confront the bullies herself', 'Suggest her brother to talk to a teacher or a school counselor']",3,"The most effective action for Sarah would be to confront the bullies herself. This way she can stop the bullying immediately and protect her brother from further abuse. Informing their parents might make things worse because it could cause more stress on the family and the bully might continue their behavior if they don't get in trouble for it. Promising to keep the secret is not a good option because it would mean that the bullying will continue unchecked and the brother will still be suffering. Finally, suggesting her brother to talk to a teacher or a school counselor might help in the long run but it won't solve the immediate problem of the bullying.

Answer: (c) Confront the bullies herself",2,"The most effective action for Sarah would be to confront the bullies herself.
