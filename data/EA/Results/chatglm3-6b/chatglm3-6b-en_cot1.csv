By giving feedback to the teacher, Hannah can express her concerns about her classmates' behavior and suggest ways to address it. This action can help to improve the class environment and prevent future interruptions.

Let's think step by step

The most effective action for Janice would be to accept the warning and be careful not to go in restricted areas from now on. This shows a willingness to accept the consequences and take action to avoid further warnings, which could potentially prevent the loss of her job. While it may not fully address the issue of the warning and the fairness of the situation, it is the most appropriate action given the circumstances.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).",1,"(a) Explain that she didn't know it was restricted: This choice shows that Janice is taking responsibility for her actions and trying to clarify her situation.

It could be an effective action for Janice to take, as it shows that she is taking the situation seriously and willing to make changes to avoid future warnings.

(c) Take a few deep breaths and calm down about it: This choice shows that Janice is trying to manage her emotions and stay calm in the face of the situation. While this may help her feel better, it may not be the most effective action for Janice in terms of addressing the issue at hand.
