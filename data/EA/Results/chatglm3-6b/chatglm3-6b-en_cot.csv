So move on and keep the good times in memories', 'Try to communicate with Kevin']",2,"To find the most effective action for Julie, we need to consider the situation and her options.

(a) Playing interactive games with Kevin could be a good way to warm up their relationship, but it may not necessarily address the underlying issue of their changing interests.

(b) Realizing it was time to give up on this friendship and moving on might be the most effective action, as it acknowledges that the friendship has changed and allows Julie to move on gracefully.

(c) Understanding that people will change is not an action that Julie can take, but it could be a mindset she needs to adopt in order to move forward.

(d) Trying to communicate with Kevin could be a good idea, but it depends on the nature of their communication and the outcome they are looking for.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).",1,"First, it's important for Julie to reflect on her feelings and reasons for wanting to spend time with Kevin. If she genuinely enjoys his company and values their friendship, then it may be worth trying to communicate with him and see if they can work through any issues.

If Julie realizes that Kevin has changed and she no longer enjoys his company, it may be best to realize it was time to give up on this friendship and move on. This can be a difficult decision, but it's ultimately what is best for both Julie and Kevin.

Understanding that people will change is also important in this scenario. It's possible that Kevin's changes are not necessarily a reflection of his personality, but rather a result of external factors. In this case, it may be helpful for Julie to focus on the good times they have shared in the past and move forward without any expectations for the future.

Playing interactive games with Kevin (Option a) could be a good way to warm up their relationship, but it's important to consider whether or not Julie genuinely enjoys his company before engaging in this activity.

(c) Understand that people will change. So move on and keep the good times in memories - This option suggests that Julie should let go of the bad memories and focus on the good ones, but it does not address the current situation with Kevin.
