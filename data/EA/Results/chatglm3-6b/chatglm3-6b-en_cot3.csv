Rhea misses the company and companionship of her workmates, so joining a playgroup or social group of new mothers would allow her to connect with other mothers and build a support system. This can help her feel less isolated and provide opportunities for her to meet new people and share experiences. While seeing if she can get back to her full-time position may be an option, it is not the most effective action in this scenario because it may not be feasible or possible to return to her old job as a full-time mother. Enjoying being a full-time mom is also important, but joining a support group can provide additional benefits and help Rhea address her feelings of loneliness and isolation. Inviting her workmates to babysit her baby is not an effective action because it would not provide her with the same support and connection that joining a playgroup or social group would offer.
