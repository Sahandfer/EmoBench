While it is understandable that Benjiro is concerned about his parents' well-being, repeatedly bringing up the subject and insisting that they need help may only create more tension and anger. Therefore, it is important for Benjiro to approach the situation with sensitivity and empathy.
Moving into his parents' house would allow Benjiro to provide hands-on care and assistance, which is particularly important for older adults who may require help with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, and medication management. Additionally, living together can provide opportunities for social interaction and support, which can improve both physical and mental health.

He may also need to consider other factors such as the cost of living and the impact on his own life before making a decision.",3,"The most effective action for Benjiro in this scenario would be (c) Frequently visit his family. While Benjiro's parents may deny needing help, regular visits can provide an opportunity to observe any changes in their behavior or physical condition.

Keeping track of their daily routines, medication schedules, and any other important details can also be helpful.

Visiting frequently can provide an opportunity for Benjiro to check in on his parents and ensure that they are okay, while also allowing them to maintain their independence and autonomy.

Similarly, using acting techniques to calm his nerves may help, but ultimately it is important for Chris to believe in himself and his ability to act.
