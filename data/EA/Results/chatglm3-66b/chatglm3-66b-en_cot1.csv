Andie needs to know the situation to be able to cope with it. By speaking to other family members and calming herself, she can gather more information and prepare herself emotionally before visiting the hospital. This option shows a balanced approach to handling the situation.
2. Reasoning for option (b):
Visiting the hospital directly may be too overwhelming for Andie, especially if she doesn't have all the necessary information. This option might lead to an emotional breakdown before she even sees her relatives.

Allowing herself to cry and express emotion is important, but it should be a part of the overall coping process. Crying alone may not provide Andie with the necessary information or support to address the situation effectively.
