  2. Mike needs to find an effective action to take in this scenario.

Now, let's look at the options:

(a) Control his emotions and find out if there is a random explanation for the shift changes: This option suggests that Mike should try to remain calm and ask his boss if there is a reason for the shift changes. This could be an effective action if there is a valid reason for the changes, such as a scheduling conflict or an emergency.
(b) See if there is some reasonable explanation for the shift changes: This option is similar to (a) and suggests that Mike should try to find out if there is a logical explanation for the shift changes. This could be an effective action if there is a valid reason for the changes, such as a scheduling conflict or an emergency.
(c) Accept the changes and do the shifts: This option suggests that Mike should simply accept the shift changes and do his job. This could be an effective action if there is no valid reason for the changes and Mike needs the job.
(d) Come up with a reason to skip working the new shifts: This option suggests that Mike should try to find a way to avoid working the new shifts. This could be an effective action if there is a valid reason for Mike to avoid the shifts, such as a personal emergency or a conflict with his studies.

Based on the options, the most effective action for Mike would be either (a) or (b), depending on whether there is a valid reason for the shift changes.
