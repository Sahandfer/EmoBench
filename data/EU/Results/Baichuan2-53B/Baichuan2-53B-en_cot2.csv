The cancellation of the exam means that Lena doesn't have to worry about performing well on the exam, which could have been stressful given her lack of preparation.

Now let's analyze the choices:

(a) This option focuses on self-doubt and bias towards the boss's decision. It doesn't address the admiration part.

(b) This option suggests that you believe the boss was biased, but it doesn't explain why you would feel disappointed.

(c) This option combines both feelings of disappointment (due to not winning the award) and admiration (for your friend's hard work), which seems to fit the scenario better.

However, you might also feel disappointed that you didn't win the award, especially since you worked hard for it. Additionally, you might feel remorse because you might think that your feelings of disappointment could overshadow your happiness for your friend.

Therefore, the answer is (c) Disappointment & Remorse.",2,"In this scenario, you might feel disappointment because you didn't win the award, which is a natural feeling when competing for something important. You might also feel remorse because your friend won the award, and you might be thinking about how you could have reacted differently or what you could have done better to win the award.

Admiration:
- You admire your friend James because you know how hard he has worked to achieve this success. You respect his dedication and effort, which is why you consider him your best friend.

4. Considering these factors, you might feel disappointed because you lost the award, but also admire your friend's achievement. You might also feel a bit of remorse if you thought about how your disappointment could affect your friendship with James.

Thirdly, since you've known each other for more than a decade and are best friends, it's likely that you genuinely care for him and believe that he has worked hard to win the award. Therefore, options (c), (f), and (e) seem to be more appropriate.

Fourthly, you haven't mentioned any evidence that suggests your boss was biased in his decision, so option (d) and (e) can be eliminated.

(a) Embarrassment & Nervousness - It's possible that James feels nervous because he knows his friend is disappointed, but embarrassment doesn't seem likely since he has done nothing wrong.
(b) Pride & Nervousness - Pride seems like a reasonable emotion since he won the award, but nervousness is also a possibility due to his friend's reaction.

Embarrassment: Naomi brought a doll with her, which may seem childish to her since she has grown up. She might feel embarrassed about having the doll with her, especially in her new environment where she will meet new people.

Based on these emotions, the correct answer is (c) She is looking forward to starting college & She is about to experience life away from her family & She has to face new problems on her own.",2,"Naomi is about to attend college abroad, which means she will be separated from her family and have to live on her own for the first time. This could bring about several emotions:

1. **Excitement**: Starting college is a new chapter in life, especially when it involves studying abroad. It's an opportunity to explore new places, meet new people, and gain independence.

2. **Sadness**: Leaving family and friends can be difficult, especially if they are far away. Naomi might feel sad about leaving her loved ones behind.

3. **Nervousness**: Living on her own for the first time can be nerve-wracking. Naomi might be worried about adapting to a new environment, making new friends, and managing her daily life without the support of her family.

Now let's consider the options:

(a) Sadness, Hopelessness, Embarrassment: While sadness is a valid emotion, hopelessness does not seem appropriate given the excitement and potential of starting college. Embarrassment might not be directly related to bringing a childhood doll.

(b) Excitement, Sadness, Embarrassment: As explained above, excitement and sadness are likely emotions, but embarrassment might not apply here unless Naomi feels ashamed of still having her doll or is concerned about how others might perceive it.

(c) Excitement, Nervousness, Annoyance: Annoyance does not seem to fit here, as there's no clear reason for Naomi to be annoyed in this scenario.

(d) Excitement, Sadness, Nervousness: These emotions make sense in the context of Naomi's situation. She's excited about the new opportunities ahead, sad to leave her family, and nervous about living on her own.

(e) Nervousness, Annoyance, Embarrassment: Again, while nervousness is a valid emotion, annoyance and embarrassment may not be directly related to this specific scenario.

(f) Sadness, Nervousness, Hopelessness: Hopelessness seems like an extreme emotion that doesn't align with the excitement of starting college.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is (d) Excitement, Sadness, Nervousness. Naomi is likely feeling a mix of these emotions as she prepares to embark on this new journey.",3,"Excitement: Naomi is excited because she is about to start a new chapter in her life, attending college abroad. This is an important milestone for her, and she is looking forward to the experiences and opportunities that come with living on her own and being independent.

Sadness: Naomi is sad because she will be separated from her family for the first time. She has a strong emotional connection with her family, and leaving them behind may make her feel a sense of loss. Additionally, the doll that her mother gave her as a child represents her childhood and the memories she shares with her family. Bringing the doll with her may remind her of the loved ones she is leaving behind.

Nervousness: Naomi is nervous about facing new problems on her own and adapting to a different environment. Living away from home and navigating college life can be challenging, and she may worry about how she will manage without the support of her family. Additionally, she may fear losing the doll, which holds sentimental value for her.

Based on these emotions, the answer that best describes why Naomi feels excitement, sadness, and nervousness in this situation is (f): She is about to experience life away from her family, she has to face new problems on her own, and she fears losing the doll.",5,"Naomi is about to attend college abroad, which means she will experience new things and meet new people. This could bring excitement (choice c, e). At the same time, it's her first time being away from her family, so she might feel nervous (choice c, d, e, f) about living on her own. 

Bringing a doll that her mother gave her as a child can be seen as a way of holding onto memories and feeling close to her family while being away. This could make her feel sad (choice a, d, f). 

Embarrassment might not be the primary emotion here because there's no direct indication that she feels ashamed of her past or the doll. 

Hopeless is also not a likely choice because there's no evidence that she feels like she can't handle the situation or her future. 

Annoyance is not mentioned as a possible emotion.

1. Embarrassment (a): When Zhongli asked Ollie to take off his shoes, Ollie might have felt embarrassed for not following the house rules or etiquette.

Now let's analyze the emotions:

(a) Embarrassment: It's possible that Ollie might feel embarrassed for not knowing or forgetting about the shoe-taking-off custom. This feeling could arise if he realizes his mistake or if Zhongli explains the reason for the request.

(b) Annoyance: It's unlikely that Ollie would feel annoyed, as Zhongli has politely asked him to take off his shoes rather than scolding or reprimanding him.

(c) Sadness: There doesn't seem to be a reason for Ollie to feel sad in this scenario.

(d) Sentimental: The scenario does not suggest any reason for Ollie to feel sentimental.

(e) Gratitude: Ollie might feel grateful to Zhongli for offering slippers and explaining the custom, as it shows consideration and hospitality.

(f) Anger: It's highly unlikely that Ollie would feel anger, as the interaction was cordial, and Zhongli did not react negatively or harshly.

This action from Zhongli shows consideration for the cleanliness of his house and respect for cultural norms.

Based on this scenario, Ollie might initially feel a bit embarrassed for not following the proper etiquette, but he would also likely appreciate Zhongli's polite and understanding approach. Therefore, the emotions that Ollie would ultimately feel in this situation could be:

(a) Embarrassment (for not taking off his shoes initially)
(e) Gratitude (for Zhongli's understanding and offering of slippers)",4,(b) Zhongli was considerate to offer him a pair of his own slippers,1

Therefore, the correct answer is (c) Admiration & Disapproval.",2,"(b) He admires Bill's progress in learning how to use chopsticks & Given his reaction, he probably disapproves of Bill putting his chopsticks upright in his rice bowl",1,(c) Admiration & Disapproval,2,"1. Xiao took the chopsticks out of the rice bowl and put them on the chopsticks rest. This action shows that Xiao is teaching Bill the proper etiquette for using chopsticks.
2. In Chinese culture, it is considered impolite to put chopsticks upright in a bowl of food, as it resembles the incense sticks placed in memory of the deceased. Therefore, Xiao might have felt disapproval towards Bill's action.
3. Since Xiao took the time to correct Bill's mistake, it can be inferred that he cares about Bill's cultural education and respects his efforts to learn how to use chopsticks. This could lead to admiration for Bill's willingness to learn.
4. The scenario does not mention any jokes or disrespectful comments, so these factors cannot be attributed to Xiao's feelings.

This gesture is a sign of hospitality and respect in Iranian culture. However, Janice declines the offer, preferring to keep her own shoes on.

Now let's analyze the emotions that Fatemeh might feel in this situation:

(a) Disapproval: This is unlikely because Fatemeh has already shown hospitality by offering the slippers, so she probably respects Janice's decision.

(b) Gratitude: This might be a feeling if Fatemeh appreciates Janice's understanding or effort to accommodate her cultural customs.

(c) Acceptance: This could be a feeling if Fatemeh accepts Janice's decision and doesn't take it personally.

(d) Pride: This might be a feeling if Fatemeh feels proud of her cultural traditions and the fact that she was able to share them with Janice, even if Janice didn't follow them.

(e) Embarrassment: This is unlikely because there is no reason for Fatemeh to feel embarrassed about her cultural customs or Janice's decision not to follow them.

(f) Joy: This might be a feeling if Fatemeh is simply happy to have Janice over for lunch and doesn't take the slipper incident too seriously.

Based on these analyses, the most likely emotions that Fatemeh would feel are gratitude (for sharing her culture), acceptance (of Janice's decision), and pride (in her cultural traditions). Therefore, the correct answer is (b), (c), and (d).",1,(d) Janice didn't offer gratitude for the lunch invitation,3,"Fatemeh, as an Iranian student, is likely familiar with Iranian customs and traditions, including offering guests slippers upon entering the house. This gesture is a sign of hospitality and respect in Iranian culture. When Janice declines the offer, it could be perceived by Fatemeh as a rejection of her cultural norms or a lack of understanding of Iranian customs.

As a result, Fatemeh might initially feel (a) Disapproval because Janice did not accept her traditional hospitality. However, since Janice politely declined and explained that she prefers her own shoes, Fatemeh might also feel (b) Gratitude for Janice's consideration and respect for her culture. Additionally, Fatemeh might experience (f) Joy from sharing her culture with Janice, even if the tradition was not fully embraced.

Now let's analyze the emotions that Fatemeh might feel in this situation:

(a) Disapproval: This is unlikely because Fatemeh has already extended the invitation and offered the slippers as a sign of hospitality. She may be slightly disappointed, but it's unlikely that she would feel disapproval towards Janice for declining the offer.

(b) Gratitude: This is also unlikely because Janice has not done anything to warrant gratitude from Fatemeh.

(c) Acceptance: This is also unlikely because Janice has declined the offer, so there is no direct expression of acceptance here.

(d) Pride: This is unlikely because Janice's decision to decline the offer does not necessarily reflect positively on Fatemeh or her culture.

(e) Embarrassment: This is a possibility because Janice has declined the offer, which may make Fatemeh feel like her cultural customs are not understood or appreciated. However, it's important to note that embarrassment can also come from a place of misunderstanding or miscommunication, rather than a negative judgment of one's culture.

(f) Joy: This is unlikely because Janice's decision to decline the offer does not seem to be something that would cause joy in Fatemeh.

Therefore, the answer is (f) She doesn't know that in China people share dishes when they go out & Ling didn't offer her a chance to order her own food.",5,"1.

3. Thirdly, Lucia might feel jealousy because she sees everyone else enjoying the food and she might wish she had the same opportunity to choose what she wants to eat.

Based on these points, the answer is (f) Disappointment & Jealousy.",5,"1. Lucia felt disappointment because she expected to be able to choose her own food, but Ling took control of ordering for the entire table without giving her a chance to do so. This might be due to cultural differences, where in some cultures, such as China, it is common for the host to order for everyone. However, since Lucia is from the US, she might not be familiar with this practice and may have expected to have more control over what she eats.

2. Lucia felt jealousy because she perceived Ling's actions as a sign of dominance or exclusion. By not allowing her to see the menu, Ling may have inadvertently communicated that she did not value Lucia's opinions or preferences. This can lead to feelings of jealousy, as Lucia may perceive Ling as having more power or status within the group.

3. Based on the scenario and the emotions described, the most likely reason for Lucia's disappointment and jealousy is that she expected to have a say in what she ate, but Ling did not give her that opportunity. This could be due to cultural differences (as mentioned above), or simply because Ling did not realize Lucia wanted to participate in the ordering process.

Therefore, the best answer is (e) Ling didn't offer her a chance to order her own food & She thinks Ling intentionally didn't let her see the menu.",4,"1. At first, Lucia might feel oblivious because she didn't realize that Ling would order for everyone without giving them a chance to choose their own dishes.
2. Then, when the food arrived and Lucia had to choose one dish to eat, she might feel disappointment because she couldn't try other dishes on the table.
3. Additionally, she might feel jealousy because she saw the variety of dishes that others were eating and wished she could also taste them.
Therefore, the correct answer is (f) Disappointment & Jealousy.",5,"1. Lucia might feel disappointed because she wasn't given an opportunity to choose what she wanted to eat. This is a common feeling when someone feels their personal choice is not being respected or acknowledged.
2. Lucia might feel jealous because she sees that Ling has more control over the situation than she does. This could be due to Ling's familiarity with the culture and customs, which gives her an advantage in making decisions.
3. Combining these two feelings, we can infer that Lucia might feel both disappointment and jealousy because she wasn't allowed to order for herself and felt left out in the decision-making process.

Based on the scenario and reasoning above, the answer seems to be (e): Ling didn't offer her a chance to order her own food & She thinks Ling intentionally didn't let her see the menu.",4,"1.

3. However, since it was a dinner gathering with friends, she might also feel joy from being included in the group and enjoying the company.

4. Lincoln might feel sadness because he wanted to connect with his new colleague but was unable to do so.

Step 1: Understand the scenario and context
Lincoln has just moved to Dubai during Ramadan, which is a significant religious observance for Muslims. During Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to dusk, abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, and engaging in sexual activities.

Step 2: Analyze Ali's response
Ali's immediate and direct ""No"" suggests that he might be taken aback or uncomfortable with the suggestion of having lunch together. This could be because it goes against the practices of Ramadan, where eating in public during daylight hours is frowned upon.

Step 3: Consider the emotions associated with the scenario
Given the context of Ramadan and Ali's response, it's likely that Ali feels fear. He might be afraid of breaking the rules of Ramadan, especially since it's a time of heightened spirituality and community adherence to Islamic practices.

Step 4: Eliminate incorrect emotions
- (a) Disapproval: Ali's response was not disapproving; it was more about discomfort or fear.
- (b) Indifferent: Ali's direct response suggests he cares enough to decline the offer but is not indifferent.
- (d) Disgust: There's no indication that Ali is disgusted by Lincoln or the suggestion.
- (e) Anger: Ali did not seem angry; his response was calm and respectful.
- (f) Nervousness: While Ali might be nervous about breaking Ramadan rules, the primary emotion seems to be fear.

Conclusion: The correct answer is (c) Fear.",2,(b) He had to reject due to religious beliefs,1,"Ali might feel multiple emotions in this situation, but primarily they could be:

(a) Disapproval - Ali might disapprove of the suggestion because it is during Ramadan and eating during daylight hours is not permissible for Muslims.

Also, the fact that he wants to throw it away suggests that he doesn't feel sentimental towards it, so option (b) can also be eliminated. This leaves us with options (d) and (f). However, since the question specifically asks about your husband's emotions, we should consider the context in which he discovered the bag. He found it while unpacking, which could have sparked his curiosity about its significance. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

(d) Sadness & Curiosity",3,(f) He doesn't want me to keep an old rusty and torn bag & He doesn't know the bag's value for me,5

When someone receives such a tribute from so many people, it's natural for them to feel gratitude. They appreciate the effort put into organizing the event and the recognition of their hard work and dedication.

Sentimentality is also likely to be felt because this is a significant moment in their life. It marks the end of a long career and the beginning of a new chapter. There might be a mix of emotions, including nostalgia for the past and excitement for the future.

Guilt might not be an appropriate emotion here unless there was some reason for Mr. Jenkins to feel guilty about his teaching career or the way he interacted with his students. Since the scenario doesn't mention any such reasons, we can assume that guilt is not an appropriate response.

Anticipation might be felt if Mr. Jenkins knew about the party beforehand, but since it's a surprise, he wouldn't know about it until the actual day. Therefore, anticipation is not an appropriate emotion in this case.

In this scenario, she is faced with a straw, which has a hole at one end. Although the straw itself might not be as triggering as other patterns with many small holes, it still contains a hole, which could cause discomfort or anxiety for someone with trypophobia.

Now let's consider the choices:

(a) Pessimism - This is not a direct emotion related to the scenario.
(b) Guilt - There is no reason for Luna to feel guilty in this situation.
(c) Unbothered - It's unlikely that Luna would be completely unbothered by the straw, given her trypophobia.

(c) She is horrified for seeing a hole in the straw - This choice is incorrect because Luna's fear is of hole patterns, not individual holes. A single hole in a straw would not trigger her trypophobia.
(d) She is afraid of patterns of hole clusters, not a single hole within a straw - This choice is correct. Luna's fear is of patterns of hole clusters, which typically involve many small holes arranged in a way that can cause discomfort or anxiety. A single hole in a straw would not create such a pattern and therefore would not trigger her trypophobia.

(c) His girlfriend constantly requested to go to Disneyland - If Andrew felt pressured or nagged by his girlfriend's repeated requests, it could lead to annoyance.

(d) He worries about getting his leg fractured again - This seems like a reasonable reason for Andrew to feel annoyed. The fear of repeating a painful and potentially serious injury could create anxiety and make him less enthusiastic about being at Disneyland.

(b) Pride - Although Ricky tried his best, it's not likely that he would feel pride since he knew he would lose.
(c) Delight - This is also unlikely as Ricky knew he would lose before challenging Ted.
(d) Embarrassment - It's possible that Ricky might feel some embarrassment after losing to someone who has been champion for seven years in a row, especially if there were spectators.

Relief: By quitting her job, Sara avoids having to work on the 13th floor, which aligns with her superstitious beliefs. This decision brings her relief as she feels she has avoided potential negative consequences associated with the number 13.

Guilt: Even though quitting brought her relief, Sara may feel guilty for letting her superstition influence such an important decision.

(b) Her favorite artist did not come to her performance - This could be disappointing, but it doesn't seem to be related to jealousy.
(c) She felt she didn't perform well - This contradicts the fact that the crowd cheered for her, so it doesn't seem likely.
(d) She was praised for emulating another artist's style - This option seems most plausible because it aligns with Catherine's desire to be original and not copy others. Being praised for sounding like someone else might make her feel like she's not being true to herself and could trigger feelings of jealousy.

Answer: (d) She was praised for emulating another artist's style",3,"(a) Disappointment - No, because she received applause from the crowd.
(b) Jealousy - No, because she was happy with her performance.
(c) Sadness - No, because she was moved by the crowd's reaction.

So, the correct answer is (e) and (f).",4,(a) She performed well in front of a huge crowd,0,"(a) Disappointment - This is unlikely as the crowd was cheering for her, which suggests they enjoyed her performance.
(b) Jealousy - There's no indication that Catherine felt jealous of anyone in this scenario.
(c) Sadness - While Catherine may have been moved to tears, it's more likely due to the positive emotions of accomplishment and gratitude rather than sadness.
(d) Guilt - There's no reason to believe that Catherine felt guilty about her performance or the way she sounded like her favorite artist.
(e) Excitement - The crowd's reaction could certainly cause excitement in Catherine, but it's not the primary emotion described in the scenario.
(f) Gratitude - It seems most likely that Catherine would feel gratitude towards the crowd for their support and appreciation of her performance.

Answer: (f) Gratitude",5,"(a) She performed well in front of a huge crowd - This is a possible reason because performing well in front of a large audience can be very satisfying and gratifying.

(b) Her favorite artist did not come to her performance - This doesn't seem to be a reason for gratitude as it's more about disappointment or relief that the pressure might have been off.

(c) She felt she didn't perform well - This contradicts the scenario where she hits a high note perfectly and the crowd cheers, so it doesn't seem likely.

(d) She was praised for emulating another artist's style - This could be a reason for gratitude because being recognized and praised for your work can be very rewarding, even if it's in a style that isn't entirely original.

Based on the information provided, I would say the most likely answer is (a) She performed well in front of a huge crowd. However, it's also possible that (d) She was praised for emulating another artist's style could play a role in her feeling of gratitude, especially since she struggled with finding her own voice.",0,"1.

2. During a live performance, she hits a high note perfectly, which reminds the audience of her favorite artist.

Based on these points, I believe that Catherine would ultimately feel a mix of emotions, including gratitude (f), excitement (e), and perhaps even a bit of sadness (c) because she hasn't yet found her unique voice as a musician. However, the primary emotion here seems to be gratitude because the crowd's reaction has made her emotional, which is often a sign of being touched or appreciative.",2,(d) She was praised for emulating another artist's style,3,"(a) Disappointment - This is unlikely because the crowd was cheering for her, which generally indicates they liked her performance.
(b) Jealousy - This doesn't fit because there's no indication that Catherine is jealous of anyone in this scenario.
(c) Sadness - It's possible that Catherine might feel a bit sad because she's struggling to find her own voice and feels like she's imitating others, but the fact that she's moved to tears by the crowd's reaction suggests there might be another emotion at play.
(d) Guilt - While it's understandable that Catherine might feel some guilt for sounding similar to her favorite artist, the crowd's positive reaction suggests they enjoyed her performance, which could mitigate the guilt somewhat.
(e) Excitement - It's likely that Catherine felt some excitement from the crowd's positive reaction to her performance.
(f) Gratitude - This seems like the most likely answer. Catherine might feel grateful for the crowd's support, especially since she was worried about being original and unique. The fact that she's moved to tears by their reaction suggests she's touched by their appreciation.

Answer: (f) Gratitude",5,"(a) She performed well in front of a huge crowd - This could be one reason why Catherine might feel gratitude. Performing well in front of a large audience can be very rewarding and fulfilling, especially for someone who is passionate about music.

(b) Her favorite artist did not come to her performance - This might not be a reason for gratitude. In fact, it could be disappointing if her favorite artist did not attend her performance.

(c) She felt she didn't perform well - If Catherine felt she didn't perform well, she might not feel grateful. However, if she later realized that she did perform well and received positive feedback from the crowd, she might feel grateful for the support and encouragement.

(d) She was praised for emulating another artist's style - This could be a reason for gratitude. Even though Catherine wanted to be original, receiving praise for emulating another artist's style could make her feel appreciated and validated as a musician.

Lastly, he might also experience (d) guilt for not being able to meet his family's expectations.",1,"(a) He was rejected from a job he didn't like - This option is correct because Greg applied for a job that satisfied his family's requirements but not his own, which means he wasn't interested in the job. Rejection can sometimes lead to anger, especially when it's something you don't care about.

(b) He was worried about the upcoming job interview - This option is incorrect because the scenario mentions that the decision letter has already come out, indicating that the job interview has already taken place.

(c) He was afraid of disappointing his family - This option is incorrect because while Greg might be concerned about disappointing his family, the scenario doesn't mention that he felt angry due to this reason.

However, it does not fully explain why he would feel ""hopeless"" as he may still have other options to explore.

(b) He was worried about the upcoming job interview - This is not a likely reason since the scenario mentions that the decision letter has already come out, indicating that the job interview has already taken place.

(c) He was afraid of disappointing his family - This is a strong possibility. Given that Greg was raised in a conservative family with limited freedom in selecting jobs, he might feel hopeless because he fears letting his family down by not getting a job that meets their expectations.

(d) He was worried about the responsibilities of the job - While this could be a concern, it does not fully explain why he would feel ""hopeless"" as he may still have other job opportunities to consider.

Greg might feel hopeless because he is concerned about failing to meet his family's expectations and not being able to find a job that satisfies both his family's requirements and his own desires.",2,"Greg was raised in a conservative family, which means he might have felt pressured to make certain decisions that align with his family's values and expectations.

When he received the rejection letter, he sighed, which can indicate various emotions such as disappointment, frustration, or relief.

The other options, (a) Relief, (d) Guilt, (e) Hopeless, and (f) Admiration, do not seem to fit the scenario as described. Relief might be a slight possibility if Greg feels relieved that he doesn't have to pursue a job he's not interested in, but it's not the primary emotion.

(c) He was afraid of disappointing his family - This is a strong possibility. Greg may have felt relieved because he no longer has to worry about taking a job that his family expected him to take, which may not have been what he wanted.

(d) He was worried about the responsibilities of the job - This is also a possibility. If the job had significant responsibilities that Greg wasn't comfortable with or didn't want, being rejected could bring him some relief.

This could lead Aiden to feel embarrassed, as he might realize that the argument wasn't worth it and that his friend might think less of him for getting so worked up over something minor.

Based on these explanations, the most likely reason for Aiden to feel embarrassed in this situation is (d) His friend was sarcastic in admitting her mistake.",3,(e) Annoyance,4,"(a) They fought about a trivial issue - This could be a reason for annoyance because Aiden might feel that the argument wasn't worth it, considering how minor the issue was.

(b) His friend sincerely admitted her mistake - If his friend genuinely apologized and admitted her mistake, Aiden might not feel annoyed but relieved or happy that they could resolve the issue.

(c) They made up after their argument - If they made up, Aiden might feel less annoyed as the tension between them has been resolved.

(d) His friend was sarcastic in admitting her mistake - This is likely the reason why Aiden feels annoyed. Sarcasm can be perceived as an insult or a sign of disrespect, especially when the intention is to minimize someone else's opinion or feelings. In this case, Aiden's friend is essentially dismissing his valid points by being sarcastic, which can lead to frustration and annoyance.",3,"Aiden is having a disagreement with his best friend over a movie. When he tries to present valid points, his friend dismisses them by repeatedly saying ""You're so right and I'm so wrong!"" This behavior can be seen as dismissive and frustrating.

Now let's analyze the choices:

(a) Embarrassment - Aiden might not feel embarrassed because it's a normal discussion between friends.

(b) Gratitude - It doesn't seem like there's anything for Aiden to be grateful for in this scenario.

(c) Amusement - While the situation might be somewhat humorous, it's unlikely that Aiden would find it amusing given the frustration he's experiencing.

(d) Disappointment - Aiden might feel disappointed that his friend isn't taking his opinions seriously or engaging in a productive conversation.

(e) Annoyance - This seems like a likely emotion for Aiden to feel, as his friend is not respecting his opinions and is making the argument one-sided.

(f) Relief - There doesn't seem to be any reason for Aiden to feel relieved in this scenario.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is (e) Annoyance.",4,"(a) They fought about a trivial issue - This could be a reason for Aiden to feel annoyed as the argument might seem unnecessary or unimportant.

(b) His friend sincerely admitted her mistake - If his friend genuinely acknowledged her mistake, it could have been a positive outcome of the argument, which might not cause annoyance.

(c) They made up after their argument - Making up after an argument can often lead to a resolution and reduce feelings of annoyance.

(d) His friend was sarcastic in admitting her mistake - This is likely the reason why Aiden feels annoyed. Sarcasm can be perceived as dismissive or disrespectful, especially when discussing a sensitive topic like a disagreement over a movie. It can make the other person feel invalidated and misunderstood, leading to frustration and annoyance.

Based on the scenario provided, the most likely answer is (d) His friend was sarcastic in admitting her mistake.",3

When someone notices a habitual behavior like shaking legs, it might make the person feel embarrassed because they realize that their behavior is noticeable to others. Additionally, if Vivian feels that her behavior could be distracting to others or inappropriate for the setting (like a lab), she might also experience guilt.

On the other hand, when someone asks if you are okay, it shows that they care about your well-being, which can be a cause of gratitude.

Considering these factors, options (b) Embarrassment & Gratitude and (d) Embarrassment & Guilt seem more plausible. It depends on how Vivian perceives the situation and her relationship with Jane.

4. **Guilt**: If Andie feels responsible for Rosy's condition, she might experience guilt.

2. **Joy**: Knowing that he performed well and the show was a success, Harry might feel joy and happiness.

3. **Gratitude**: When Naira compliments him on his performance, Harry might feel grateful for her support and positive feedback.

This indicates that she might not be used to or doesn't like the taste of vegetarian food. So, option (e) can be eliminated.

Fatima then asked Jennifer why she didn't add any meat to the lasagna, which suggests that she wasn't aware of Jennifer's dietary choices. So, options (a), (b), (c), and (f) can be eliminated because they all include ""Oblivious"" as an emotion, which is incorrect in this case.

That leaves us with option (d) - Embarrassment & Guilt. Fatima would likely feel embarrassed for making a face of disgust in front of her host, Jennifer, and for not knowing about Jennifer's dietary preferences. Additionally, she might feel guilty for not appreciating Jennifer's effort in making a dish that accommodates her ethical beliefs.

So, the correct answer is (d) Embarrassment & Guilt.",3,"Fatima felt embarrassed because she made a face of disgust when tasting the lasagna, which could be interpreted as a lack of appreciation for Jennifer's efforts in preparing the meal. Additionally, Fatima was unaware of Jennifer's new dietary choices, which led to her questioning why there was no meat in the dish. This could have made Fatima feel like she had inadvertently offended Jennifer or that she had acted ungrateful towards her host.

Fatima also felt gratitude because Jennifer had gone out of her way to prepare a meal for her and her family, despite knowing that Fatima might not be familiar with or appreciate a vegetarian dish. The fact that Jennifer still included them in the dinner shows that she values their relationship and wants to share her new dietary choices with them. This consideration from Jennifer likely made Fatima grateful for her hospitality and effort.",-1,"Fatima initially showed a reaction of disgust when tasting the vegetarian lasagna. This could be due to her not being aware of Jennifer's dietary choices or simply because she is not used to eating vegetarian food.

Fatima might feel embarrassed for making a face of disgust in front of her neighbor and for questioning her dietary choices. Additionally, she might also feel guilty for not respecting Jennifer's ethical decision to adopt a vegetarian diet.

Therefore, the correct answer is (c) Embarrassment & Guilt.",2,"1. Fatima took a bite of the lasagna and made a face of disgust, which suggests that she did not like the taste of the lasagna.

(b) Excitement - Linda might have felt excitement initially when she saw the designer she admired, but this feeling would likely diminish after hearing Melissa's comment.

(c) Disappointment - Linda might feel disappointed that Melissa did not enjoy the event as much as she expected or hoped.

(d) Boredom - This does not apply because Linda is a clothing enthusiast and would not be bored at a fashion show.

(e) Guilt - Linda might feel a little guilty for expecting Melissa to enjoy the event if she knew Melissa was not interested in fashion.

(f) Nervousness - This does not apply because there is no indication that Linda was nervous during the event.

Based on the scenario, Linda would ultimately feel disappointment and possibly a little guilt.",2,(d) Her friend really enjoyed the show,3,"Linda invited Melissa to a fashion show because she thought it would be a fun activity for them to do together. She was also excited about seeing the collection of a designer she admired. So initially, Linda might have felt (b) excitement about the event.

However, when Melissa said that the fashion show was the best sleep she had in a while, it suggests that Melissa did not enjoy the event or find it interesting. This could lead Linda to feel (c) disappointment, as she might have hoped that Melissa would share her enthusiasm for fashion and the show.

Additionally, Linda might feel (a) oblivious for not realizing that Melissa might not have enjoyed the event as much as she did. She might wonder if she should have chosen a different activity that both of them would have enjoyed.

Therefore, the emotions Linda would ultimately feel in this situation are (a) oblivious, (b) excitement, (c) disappointment, and possibly some level of (e) guilt for not realizing that Melissa might not have enjoyed the event.",0,(c) Her friend does not like the show she admired,2,"(a) Oblivious - Linda knew about the designer and was excited to see her collection, so she wouldn't be oblivious.
(b) Excitement - Linda was excited about seeing the designer's collection, but Melissa's comment might dampen her excitement somewhat.
(c) Disappointment - Linda might feel disappointed because her friend didn't share her enthusiasm for the event.
(d) Boredom - Linda was excited about the fashion show, so she wouldn't feel boredom.
(e) Guilt - Linda might feel guilty for inviting Melissa to an event that she didn't enjoy.
(f) Nervousness - Linda might feel nervous about how her friend feels about the event and whether they will still want to do fun activities together.

Final answer: (c) Disappointment",2,(c) Her friend does not like the show she admired,2

Linda was also looking forward to seeing her favorite designer's collection. Therefore, Linda likely felt excitement about the event. 

However, when Melissa said it was the best sleep she had in a while, it suggests that she might not have enjoyed the fashion show or understood its importance to Linda. This could lead to feelings of disappointment on Linda's part because she wanted Melissa to share her enthusiasm for the event. Additionally, Linda might feel nervous about how Melissa perceived the event and whether their friendship will be affected by this difference in interest.

Therefore, the correct answer is (a) Excitement & Nervousness.",0,"1. Linda invited Melissa to a fashion show, which means Linda thought it would be fun for both of them.
2. Linda admired the closing designer, so she was excited about seeing her collection.
3. After the show, Melissa said it was the best sleep she has had in a while.

Now let's analyze the choices:

(a) This choice suggests that Melissa didn't find the show interesting and has a different taste in fashion. It doesn't explain why she would feel nervousness.
(b) This choice suggests that Melissa is glad she could get some rest and didn't find the show interesting. It doesn't explain why she would feel nervousness.
(c) This choice suggests that Melissa is glad she could get some rest and didn't want to make Linda feel bad. It explains why she might feel nervous (not wanting to upset Linda) but not excitement.
(d) This choice suggests that Melissa is glad she could get some rest and has a different taste in fashion. It doesn't explain why she would feel nervousness.
(e) This choice suggests that Melissa didn't find the show interesting and doesn't know Linda admires the show. It doesn't explain why she would feel nervousness.
(f) This choice suggests that Melissa didn't find the show interesting and really enjoyed the show. This contradicts itself and is therefore incorrect.

Based on the information given, none of the choices perfectly fits the scenario. However, if we consider that Melissa might have felt nervous because she didn't want to disappoint Linda by not enjoying the show, and excited because she managed to get some rest during the event, then option (c) comes closest. But even this option doesn't fully explain the excitement part.

So, based on the available information, there doesn't seem to be a clear answer to the question. We can assume that Melissa might have been excited about getting some rest and nervous about potentially disappointing Linda, but this is not explicitly stated in the scenario.",2,"Melissa said that the fashion show was the best sleep she has had in a while, which suggests that she found the event dull or uninteresting. Therefore, we can infer that Melissa felt boredom.

However, since she is with Linda, who seems to be enjoying the event, Melissa might also feel some guilt for not sharing the same excitement as her friend.

So, the correct answer is (b) Boredom & Oblivious.",1,"Melissa said ""that was the best sleep I have had in a while,"" which means she might not have found the fashion show very interesting or engaging. This suggests that she might have been bored during the event. Additionally, she chose to express her feelings in a way that was not directly critical of the event, possibly because she didn't want to make Linda feel bad about inviting her to something she didn't enjoy. Therefore, the answer is (c) She is glad she could get some rest & She didn't want to make Linda feel bad.",2,"Linda invited Melissa to a fashion show, which is an exciting event for someone who appreciates clothing and fashion. Linda was particularly looking forward to seeing the work of a designer she admires. These facts suggest that Linda expected Melissa to share her enthusiasm for the event.

When Melissa responded by saying it was the best sleep she had in a while, she indicated that she did not enjoy the fashion show and may have been unaware of Linda's expectations or the significance of the event to Linda. This suggests that Melissa felt bored during the event and was oblivious to Linda's excitement about the designer.

Based on these observations, the correct answer is (b) Boredom & Oblivious.",1,"Linda invited Melissa to a fashion show, which indicates that Linda thought it would be a fun activity for both of them. Linda also mentioned that she admired the closing designer, which means she expected Melissa to enjoy the show as well. However, when Melissa commented that it was the best sleep she had in a while, it suggests that she might not have found the show interesting or exciting.

Now let's analyze the choices:

(a) This choice suggests that Melissa didn't find the show interesting and she has a different taste in fashion. It aligns with the fact that she felt like sleeping during the event.

(b) This choice suggests that Melissa is glad she could get some rest and she didn't find the show interesting. It aligns with the fact that she felt like sleeping during the event.

(c) This choice suggests that Melissa is glad she could get some rest and she didn't want to make Linda feel bad. However, there's no evidence in the scenario that Melissa was concerned about making Linda feel bad.

(d) This choice suggests that Melissa is glad she could get some rest and she has a different taste in fashion. It aligns with the fact that she felt like sleeping during the event.

(e) This choice suggests that Melissa didn't find the show interesting and she doesn't know Linda admires the show. However, we can infer from the scenario that Melissa must have known Linda admired the closing designer because Linda invited her to the show.

(f) This choice suggests that Melissa didn't find the show interesting and she really enjoyed the show. This contradicts the fact that she felt like sleeping during the event.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate answer seems to be (b) She is glad she could get some rest & She didn't find the show interesting. This aligns with the fact that Melissa felt like sleeping during the event, indicating boredom or lack of interest.",1,"Linda invited Melissa to a fashion show, which is an exciting event for someone who loves clothes. Linda might feel excitement about attending the event and seeing her favorite designer's collection. However, she might also feel nervous because she wants Melissa to enjoy the experience as much as she does.

Melissa, on the other hand, might not share Linda's enthusiasm for fashion shows. She might find the event boring and not understand its appeal. This could lead to feelings of guilt, as she might feel bad for not enjoying something that Linda clearly enjoys.

Therefore, the emotions that Melissa would ultimately feel in this situation are boredom and guilt.

The correct answer is (b) Boredom & Guilt.",1,(b) She is glad she could get some rest & She didn't find the show interesting,1,(b) Boredom & Oblivious,1,"Melissa said ""that was the best sleep I have had in a while,"" which means she might not have found the fashion show very interesting or engaging.

(b) Embarrassment - It's possible to feel embarrassed if you know your performance did not meet expectations or if you feel judged by your peers.
(c) Nervousness - This might be a feeling initially upon receiving the grade, but it's more likely to turn into another emotion over time.
(d) Sadness - Receiving a low grade can often lead to feelings of sadness or disappointment, especially if you worked hard on the test.
(e) Pride - Unlikely, as getting an F grade typically does not evoke pride.
(f) Disappointment - This is a likely emotion to feel, as receiving an F grade may indicate that your performance was below what you had hoped for or expected.

Based on the scenario and the choices provided, the most appropriate answer would be (d) Sadness and (f) Disappointment.",3,(a) My teacher didn't appreciate my hard work,0,"(b) Embarrassment - You might feel embarrassed because your teacher gave you an 'F', which is considered a low grade in most educational systems.
(f) Disappointment - You might feel disappointed with your performance on the exam and the grade you received.",5,"In this scenario, you might feel disappointment because:

(a) My teacher didn't appreciate my hard work - This is incorrect. The teacher appreciates your hard work by giving you the highest grade (F).

(b) I failed the difficult test - This is also incorrect. You received the highest grade on the test, which means you did well.

(c) I aced a difficult test - This is correct. Even though you received the highest grade, the fact that ""F"" is traditionally associated with failure can still lead to disappointment.

(d) I thought I got the lowest grade but it was the highest - This is incorrect. You actually received the highest grade, not the lowest.

So, the answer to why you might feel disappointment in this situation is (c) I aced a difficult test.

(c) I aced a difficult test - This is correct. You received the highest grade on the test, which means you did well.

(d) I thought I got the lowest grade but it was the highest - This is also correct. The confusion comes from the fact that most people associate the letter ""F"" with failure, so when you first saw the grade, you might have been surprised or embarrassed because you thought you had received a low grade.

The answer is (c) and (d). You aced a difficult test, but you were initially confused and embarrassed because you thought you had received a low grade.",2,"Firstly, you might feel (c) Nervousness when you see the grade because you are unsure of what it means in this context.

Lastly, you might feel (f) Disappointment because even though your teacher thinks highly of you, the grade does not reflect well on your performance compared to other grading systems.",1,"(a) My teacher didn't appreciate my hard work - This is not necessarily true because the teacher gave you an ""F"" which means he appreciated your effort and considered you to have fully completed the task.

(b) I failed the difficult test - This is incorrect because the scenario mentions that the teacher considers ""F"" to be the highest grade, not a failing grade.

(c) I aced a difficult test - This is correct. Since the teacher considers ""F"" to be the highest grade, getting an ""F"" on a difficult test means you did very well.

(d) I thought I got the lowest grade but it was the highest - This is also correct. The scenario suggests that you were under the impression that ""F"" was the lowest grade, so when you received an ""F,"" you might have initially felt embarrassed thinking you had done poorly. However, upon realizing that ""F"" actually stood for ""Full"" and represented the highest grade, you would likely feel relieved and proud of your achievement.

(a) My teacher didn't appreciate my hard work - This could be a reason for disappointment as you might feel like your effort wasn't recognized or valued by the teacher.

(b) I failed the difficult test - If you believe that getting an F means failing the test, then this would be a valid reason for feeling disappointed.

(c) I aced a difficult test - This doesn't seem to be a likely reason for disappointment in this context, as it suggests that you did well on the test.

(d) I thought I got the lowest grade but it was the highest - This is unlikely to be the case based on the information provided in the scenario, as the teacher has stated that F stands for Full, not the lowest grade.

Based on the scenario, (a) and (b) are potential reasons for disappointment. However, if we consider the teacher's belief that F stands for Full, then (b) may not be accurate. Therefore, the most logical answer is (a): My teacher didn't appreciate my hard work.",0

However, (e) Pessimism and (f) Remorse are not explicitly mentioned in the scenario, so (c) Embarrassment is the most apparent emotion based on the information provided.",2,"(a) He is familiar with getting a lower-than-expected or failing mark on all of his subjects - This choice does not directly address why Timmy would feel embarrassment in this specific situation. It's more about his overall performance rather than the current event.

(b) He thought he would ace the geography test - This choice seems plausible because if Timmy expected to do well on the geography test but instead failed, he might feel embarrassed about not meeting his own expectations.

(c) He has a lot of friends who support him - While having supportive friends can be comforting, it doesn't necessarily explain why Timmy would feel embarrassed in this particular situation.

(d) He is fed up with failing up all the time - This choice suggests that Timmy is tired of failing, which could lead to frustration or disappointment, but it doesn't directly address the feeling of embarrassment.

Based on the scenario, Timmy might feel embarrassed because he did not meet his own expectations (choice b), especially since he has consistently performed poorly in his subjects. Therefore, the answer is (b) He thought he would ace the geography test.",1,"1. Timmy has consistently received low grades, suggesting that he might have developed a sense of pessimism about his academic performance.
2. When he fails the geography test, he seems to accept the result without showing any strong emotions, which suggests that he might be feeling unbothered or resigned to the situation.
3. However, considering that he has consistently struggled academically, he might also feel embarrassment when he sees his failing grade, especially since he is with his friends.
4. There is no evidence of disgust, nervousness, or remorse in the scenario.

Based on the information given, the most likely emotions Timmy would feel are (c) embarrassment and (e) pessimism.",2,"(a) He is familiar with getting a lower-than-expected or failing mark on all of his subjects - This choice does not explain why Timmy would feel embarrassment in this specific situation. It only explains his general academic performance.

(b) He thought he would ace the geography test - This choice could be the reason for Timmy feeling embarrassed because he might have expected to do well in the test but ended up failing, which contradicts his expectations.

(c) He has a lot of friends who support him - This choice does not explain why Timmy would feel embarrassment in this situation. It only mentions that he has supportive friends.

(d) He is fed up with failing up all the time - This choice explains Timmy's frustration with his consistent failure, but it does not directly address why he would feel embarrassed in this particular situation.

Based on the scenario, Timmy might feel embarrassed because he did not meet his own expectations (choice b), especially if he thought he would perform well in the geography test.",1,"Based on the scenario provided, Timmy has consistently received low marks on his subjects, leading him to have low expectations for his performance. When he fails the geography test, he initially stares at the paper blankly before putting it away and going to the canteen with his friends.

Considering these details, Timmy might experience several emotions:

1. **Disappointment**: Timmy might be disappointed with his performance on the geography test, as he has likely been working hard to improve his grades.
2. **Acceptance/Pessimism**: Given his consistent history of low grades, Timmy might have developed a pessimistic attitude towards his academic performance, accepting failure as an expected outcome.
3. **Embarrassment**: Failing the test could make Timmy feel embarrassed, especially if he is worried about how his friends will perceive his performance.
4. **Unbothered**: Timmy might also appear unbothered by the failure, as he may have become desensitized to receiving low grades.
5. **Remorse**: Although not explicitly stated, Timmy might feel remorse for not doing well on the test, especially if he knows he could have performed better.

Out of the choices provided, the most fitting answer seems to be (c) Embarrassment, followed by (e) Pessimism, as Timmy might have accepted his low grades as a norm and does not show immediate signs of strong negative emotions such as disgust or nervousness. However, it's important to note that multiple emotions can be experienced simultaneously, and Timmy's reaction might be a combination of several feelings rather than just one.",2,(b) He thought he would ace the geography test,1,"(c) Embarrassment
(e) Pessimism",4,"(a) He is familiar with getting a lower-than-expected or failing mark on all of his subjects. This choice is correct because Timmy has always received low grades or failing marks in all of his subjects, which may have led him to develop a pessimistic attitude about his academic performance.

(b) He thought he would ace the geography test. This choice is not correct because the scenario does not indicate that Timmy expected to do well on the geography test. In fact, the scenario suggests that Timmy is used to receiving low grades or failing marks.

(c) He has a lot of friends who support him. This choice is not relevant to why Timmy might feel pessimism in this situation. While having supportive friends can be beneficial, it does not necessarily address the issue of Timmy's pessimistic attitude toward his academic performance.

(d) He is fed up with failing up all the time. This choice is not correct because while Timmy may be frustrated with his consistent failure, the scenario does not indicate that he feels pessimism specifically due to being fed up.

Therefore, the correct answer is (a) He is familiar with getting a lower-than-expected or failing mark on all of his subjects.",0

Additionally, since John has been studying hard and caring a lot about the competition, he might also feel jealousy towards those who did win, especially if he feels like he put in more effort than others or thought he had a good chance of winning.

Therefore, the correct answer is (f) Disappointment & Jealousy.",5,"John may feel disappointment because he worked hard for the math competition and expected to win.

Jealousy might arise if John believes that someone else who did not put in as much effort as him won the competition. This could lead him to feel envious of the winner's success and question the fairness of the competition.

Based on the choices provided, option (a) aligns with the scenario described. It states that John studied hard for the test and is expecting to win, which can explain his disappointment, and his teacher praised his hard work, which could potentially fuel his jealousy towards the winner if he feels that his efforts were not rewarded.",0,"John has been working hard for the math competition, so he must be hopeful about his performance.

Therefore, the correct answer is (f) Disappointment & Jealousy.",5,"John might feel disappointment because he studied hard for the math competition and was expecting to win. However, he did not achieve the desired result. This can lead to disappointment as he may have put a lot of effort into preparing for the competition.

John might also feel jealousy if he knows or suspects that someone else won the competition without putting in as much effort as he did. This feeling of jealousy could arise due to the unfairness he perceives in the situation, where he feels that his hard work was not rewarded.

Now let's analyze the choices:

(a) This option suggests that John studied hard for the test and is expecting to win, and his teacher praised his hard work. This could contribute to both disappointment (not winning) and jealousy (if he feels others won easily or undeservedly).

(b) This option suggests that John studied hard for the test and is expecting to win, but he realized he failed the test. This could contribute to disappointment, but not necessarily to jealousy unless there's more context suggesting he felt others were undeserving winners.

(c) This option suggests that his teacher praised his hard work, and he realized he failed the test. This could contribute to disappointment, but not necessarily to jealousy unless there's more context suggesting he felt others were undeserving winners.

(d) This option suggests that he was told by his friends that he had won, but he realized he failed the test. This could contribute to disappointment, and possibly to jealousy if he feels others were undeserving winners.

(e) This option suggests that John does not know the results, and he was told by his friends that he had won. Since John doesn't know the actual results, he wouldn't feel disappointment or jealousy based on the information given.

(f) This option suggests that John does not know the results, and he studied hard for the test and is expecting to win. Since John doesn't know the actual results, he wouldn't feel disappointment or jealousy based on the information given.

Based on the scenario and the options provided, the answer that best fits the description of why John might feel disappointment and jealousy is (a) John studied hard for the test and is expecting to win, and his teacher praised his hard work.",0,"John has been studying hard for the math competition for the past two weeks. This shows his dedication and hope to win the competition. However, when you find out that he didn't win, it's likely that he will feel disappointed because his efforts didn't pay off as expected.

Additionally, since you are the only one who knows the results and the teacher has asked you not to tell anyone, John is oblivious to the outcome. He doesn't know whether he won or lost, which can cause him to feel anxious or nervous about the results.

Therefore, the emotions that John would ultimately feel in this situation are disappointment and obliviousness. The correct answer is (a) Nervousness & Oblivious.",0,"John might feel nervous because he has been studying hard for the math competition and is expecting to win.

Now let's consider the remaining options. Since John didn't win, he might feel disappointed. This eliminates (a) and (c).

We are left with (d) and (f). Since John didn't win, he might feel jealousy towards the winner, especially if he feels like he worked really hard and deserved to win. This eliminates (d).

Therefore, the correct answer is (f) Disappointment & Jealousy.",5,"John may feel disappointment because he studied hard for the math competition and expected to win.

John may also feel jealousy if he knows or suspects that someone else has achieved better results than him despite not putting in as much effort. This could be due to natural talent, luck, or other factors that are beyond John's control.

Now let's analyze the choices:

(a) John studied hard for the test and is expecting to win & His teacher praised his hard work - This choice suggests that John worked hard and received positive feedback from his teacher, which might increase his expectations of winning. If he doesn't win, he might feel disappointed and jealous.

(b) John studied hard for the test and is expecting to win & He realized he failed the test - This choice suggests that John knew he failed, which might lead to disappointment but not necessarily jealousy unless he knows others succeeded easily.

(c) His teacher praised his hard work & He realized he failed the test - This choice suggests that John received positive feedback but still failed, which might lead to disappointment but not necessarily jealousy.

(d) He was told by his friends that he had won & He realized he failed the test - This choice suggests that John had false hope, which might lead to disappointment and anger towards his friends for misleading him.

(e) John does not know the results & He was told by his friends that he had won - This choice suggests that John had false hope, which might lead to disappointment when he finds out the truth. However, it's unlikely to cause jealousy since he didn't know the actual results.

(f) John does not know the results & John studied hard for the test and is expecting to win - This choice suggests that John worked hard and expected to win, but he doesn't know the results yet. He might feel anxious but not necessarily disappointed or jealous until he finds out the outcome.

Based on the scenario, the most appropriate answer is (a) John studied hard for the test and is expecting to win & His teacher praised his hard work. This choice aligns with the potential feelings of disappointment and jealousy that John might experience after finding out the results of the math competition.",0,"John has been working hard for the past two weeks preparing for the math competition.

Now, we know that John did not win the competition. This will likely lead to disappointment, as he worked hard and had high expectations. We can eliminate (a) and (c) because they do not include ""disappointment"" as an emotion.

Since John is oblivious to the results, he does not know that he did not win, which eliminates (d) and (f).

1. **Disappointment**: Ben may feel disappointed because he couldn't save the company he built from scratch. This could be due to various factors such as the impact of COVID-19 on businesses, poor management, or unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, Ben might also feel disappointed in himself for not being able to find a new job, which could lead to financial stability and support his family.

Based on the scenario, Ben might feel several emotions:

1. **Embarrassment**: Declaring bankruptcy can be a very embarrassing situation, especially when you have built something from scratch. It might make him feel like he has failed as an entrepreneur.

2. **Disappointment**: Ben might feel disappointed that things didn't work out as planned and that he couldn't keep the business running.

3. **Remorse**: He might also feel remorse for not being able to provide for his family or employees as he had hoped.

4. **Anxiety**: The uncertainty of the future and the stress of finding a new job could cause anxiety.

(b) He failed to keep his business from bankruptcy & His family caused his business to go bankrupt - This option is incorrect because the scenario does not mention that Ben's family caused the bankruptcy.

(c) He felt that he would be a burden to his family if he shared the news about bankruptcy & His family caused his business to go bankrupt - This option is incorrect because the scenario does not mention that Ben's family caused the bankruptcy.

(d) He felt that he would be a burden to his family if he shared the news about bankruptcy & He cannot repay his company debts - This option is incorrect because it does not mention the reason why Ben might feel remorse and disappointment.

This behavior can lead to feelings of guilt, as he knows he is hurting someone who loves him and has been faithful to him.

Additionally, Tom is planning to break up with Janice to be with another woman. This decision will likely bring some level of joy, as he is moving on to a new relationship. However, it could also bring embarrassment, as he will have to face the consequences of his actions and deal with the potential backlash from friends, family, and society.

Considering all these factors, the most appropriate answer is (e) Guilt.

Here are some possible emotions Tom might feel:

(a) Joy - This could be a possibility if Tom feels relieved that he will no longer have to hide his true feelings or the fact that he's been cheating. However, it's also important to consider the potential negative emotions that come with ending a long-term relationship.

(b) Admiration - While admiration could play a role in Tom's decision to end the relationship (admiring the other woman more), it's not necessarily the primary emotion he would feel in this situation.

(c) Embarrassment - Ending a long-term relationship can be an embarrassing experience, especially if there are friends or family involved who know both people.

(d) Caring - It's possible that Tom still cares about Janice, but not in the way she might want or expect. The fact that he's been cheating suggests that his feelings for her have changed, but it doesn't mean he doesn't care at all.

(e) Guilt - Cheating on someone and then breaking up with them is likely to cause guilt, especially if you've been with that person for a significant amount of time. Even if Tom is sure about his decision, the act of hurting someone you've spent a decade with is bound to bring about some level of guilt.

(f) Oblivious - This option doesn't really apply because Tom knows what he's doing and the consequences of his actions.

This shows her determination and resilience. When she finally receives the offer from her favorite company, she starts crying which indicates that she is overwhelmed with emotions. 

Now let's analyze the choices:

(a) Delight & Disappointment - She might feel delighted because she got the job but disappointed because she was crying.
(b) Embarrassment & Disappointment - She might feel embarrassed because her mom saw her crying but disappointed doesn't seem to fit here.
(c) Relief & Embarrassment - She might feel relieved because she finally got the job but embarrassed because her mom saw her crying.

(e) Embarrassment & Hopeless - She might feel embarrassed because her mom saw her crying but hopeless doesn't seem to fit here.
(f) Embarrassment & Nervousness - She might feel embarrassed because her mom saw her crying but nervousness doesn't seem to fit here.

Considering all these points, the most appropriate answer seems to be (c) Relief & Embarrassment. Susan would feel relieved because she finally achieved her goal after so many rejections and embarrassed because her mom saw her crying.",2,"Susan has been through a long process of applying for jobs and facing rejections. This can be a very stressful experience, especially when it seems like no matter how hard you try, you can't get a break. So, when she finally receives an offer from one of her favorite companies, she experiences relief because she has achieved her goal and her efforts have paid off.

Embarrassment might set in because she was emotional enough to cry in front of her mom. It's common for people to feel embarrassed about showing strong emotions, especially in front of loved ones. Additionally, Susan may feel a bit vulnerable after going through such a difficult time, and being comforted by her mom might make her feel even more exposed.

So, based on the scenario provided, the answer that best fits the situation is (e) She got a job offer from one of her favorite companies & Her mom comforted her after seeing her cry.",4,"Susan has been through a lot of rejections while looking for a job. This means she might have felt disappointment and frustration during this process. However, when she finally receives the offer from one of her favorite companies, she starts crying.

So, based on the given scenario, the answer is:

(d) Delight & Relief",3,"The correct answer is (f). In this scenario, Susan experienced both delight and relief due to two main reasons: 1) she got a job offer from one of her favorite companies, which is a significant achievement after facing multiple rejections; and 2) her mother comforted her after seeing her cry, providing emotional support and reassurance during a time of happiness and relief.",5,"Susan has been through a lot of rejections but she didn't give up. She kept pursuing her goals and updating her resume. So when she finally got the job, it was a big relief for her because she achieved her goal.

Now let's look at the remaining choices (a) and (d). 

Susan was crying which could be due to happiness or disappointment. However, since she got the job at one of her favorite companies, it's more likely that she was crying out of happiness rather than disappointment. Therefore, we can eliminate (a) as it includes ""Disappointment"".

So, the final answer is (d) Delight & Relief.",3,"Susan received an email informing her that she got a job at one of her favorite companies. This news would cause her to feel delight because it means she has achieved her goal of working for a company she admires. Additionally, she experienced numerous rejections throughout her job search, so receiving this offer would also bring relief as it ends the uncertainty and stress of not knowing if she would ever find a job.

When her mom saw her crying and came to comfort her, this would add to the emotional impact of the situation. Having someone she cares about support her in this moment would make her feel loved and cared for, which can amplify the feelings of delight and relief.

Considering all these factors, the correct answer is (e) She got a job offer from one of her favorite companies & Her mom comforted her after seeing her cry.",4,"Susan has been through a lot of rejections, so when she finally receives an offer from a company she likes, it's natural for her to feel relieved.

Now, considering the emotions she might feel upon being hugged by her mom while crying, embarrassment could be one of them. She might feel a bit awkward about being seen in such a vulnerable state by her mom.

Step by step thinking process:
1. The teacher gave a warning not to cheat during the exam, which means he/she doesn't want students to engage in dishonest behavior.
2. When the teacher left the room, the students started collaborating on the answers, which is cheating.
3. When the teacher returned, he/she saw an organized and silent class, which could be seen as a positive sign of respect for the classroom environment and discipline.
4. However, the teacher also knows that the students were cheating while he/she was away, which leads to disapproval.
5. Admiration could be felt because the students managed to work together silently and quickly, showing some level of organization and teamwork.
6. Guilt and sadness are unlikely emotions because the teacher didn't participate in the cheating, and there's no reason for him/her to feel sad or guilty about the students' actions.",4,"The correct answer is (d) the students cheated on the exam when the teacher asked them not to & nobody talked when the teacher was away.

Here's why:

1. The teacher gave a warning not to cheat during the exam, so if the students did cheat, it would be a violation of the rules and expectations set by the teacher. This could make the teacher feel disappointed or sad because the students didn't respect his instructions.

2. The teacher might feel guilty because, as the authority figure in the classroom, he or she feels responsible for maintaining order and ensuring fair testing conditions. If the students cheated under his watch, he might feel like he failed in his duty.

3. The fact that the students were organized and silent when the teacher returned could be seen as a sign of guilt or nervousness, which might reinforce the teacher's suspicions that cheating had occurred.

4. Options (a), (c), (e), and (f) suggest that the teacher doesn't know that the students cheated, which contradicts the scenario where the teacher witnesses an organized and silent class, which could be interpreted as a sign of guilt.

5. Option (b) suggests that the teacher admires the students' initiative, but this doesn't explain the feelings of guilt and sadness mentioned in the question.

Therefore, the most logical answer is (d) the students cheated on the exam when the teacher asked them not to & nobody talked when the teacher was away. This option addresses both the potential cheating and the teacher's feelings of responsibility and disappointment.",3,"The correct answer is (b) Admiration & Disapproval.

Here's why:
1. The teacher initially gave a warning not to cheat during the exam, so when the students started collaborating while the teacher was away, it showed that they were smart and capable of working together. This could lead to a feeling of admiration for their intelligence and teamwork.
2. However, this collaboration was cheating, which goes against the rules and values the teacher has set for the class. This could lead to a feeling of disapproval because the students did not follow the instructions given by the teacher.
3. Other emotions such as oblivious, gratitude, guilt, and sadness do not apply here because the teacher is not oblivious to what happened, there is no reason to feel grateful, the students are the ones who should feel guilty, and there is no direct cause for sadness in this scenario.",1,"The correct answer is (e) the teacher admires the students' self-discipline for keeping the class quiet and organized while he was away & the teacher does not know that the students cheated when he was away.

Here's why:

1. The teacher gave a warning not to cheat during the exam, so it's unlikely that he would admire the students for cheating.

4. The other options either imply knowledge of cheating or focus on aspects unrelated to the scenario (such as academic struggles).",4,"The correct answer is (b) Admiration & Disapproval.

When the teacher came back from the bathroom and saw that the class had stopped cheating and returned to a quiet, organized state, they might have felt a sense of admiration for the students' ability to quickly return to a proper exam environment.

(a) She overheard Daniel talking about his nervousness - This could be a reason for disappointment if Janet thought that Daniel was nervous because he was considering asking her to the prom. However, it doesn't directly indicate that he won't ask her or that he's planning to ask someone else.

(b) Janet's friends told her that Daniel would ask her - If Janet's friends gave her false hope or information, she might feel disappointed when she finds out that they were wrong.

(c) She found out that Daniel is going to ask Lisa - This is the most direct reason for disappointment as it indicates that Daniel is not planning to ask Janet to the prom but rather someone else.

(d) She knows Daniel is going to ask her to prom - This option contradicts the scenario, as it states that Daniel is actually planning to ask Lisa.

Therefore, the correct answer is (c) She found out that Daniel is going to ask Lisa. This is the most logical explanation for Janet's disappointment, as it directly relates to the fact that Daniel is not interested in taking her to the prom.",2
