"['Annoyance', 'Nervousness', 'Fear', 'Amusement', 'Unbothered', 'Disapproval']",3,"['He enjoys confrontations', 'He loves traffic', 'He enjoys being called a bad driver.', 'The person shouting at him turned out to be his dad']",3,"The first thing I need to do is understand the context of the story. In this case, Andre is stuck in traffic and someone starts shouting at him for being a bad driver. Then, he realizes it's his dad.

Now, let's analyze each emotion option and see if it fits the context:

- Annoyance: This is a strong feeling of displeasure or irritation. It doesn't seem like the right emotion because Andre didn't start the argument. He was just stuck in traffic and got attacked by his dad.

- Nervousness: This is an uncomfortable feeling of anxiety or worry. It also doesn't seem appropriate because Andre wasn't nervous before his dad started shouting at him.

- Fear: This is an intense feeling of anxiety and dread. It's possible that Andre felt some level of fear due to the unexpected confrontation, but it's not the main emotion he would feel in this situation.

- Amusement: This is the feeling of pleasure or interest caused by something amusing or surprising. It's not a suitable option because Andre wouldn't find the situation amusing.

- Unbothered: This is the feeling of not being affected or bothered by something. It's possible that Andre felt unbothered after the incident because he knew his dad would eventually apologize. However, it's not the main emotion he would feel in this situation.

- Disapproval: This is the feeling of not agreeing or approving of something. It seems like a suitable option because Andre might have felt disapproval towards his dad's behavior.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is (f) Disapproval.",5,Andre felt disapproval because he realized that the person who shouted at him was his father.,-1,"The most important thing is to understand the context and the background information provided in the problem. The story tells us that Andre was stuck in traffic because of the behavior of another driver. His father saw him and accused him of being a bad driver. This makes Andre feel angry or annoyed.
最终答案：（a）。",0,Andre felt disapproval because he realized that the person who shouted at him was his father.,-1,"The most likely emotional response is ""annoyance"" because Andre was stuck in traffic and then his father shouted at him. This can be very irritating and annoying.",0,Andre felt disapproval because he realized that the person who shouted at him was his father.,-1,"The first thing I need to do is understand the context of the story. In this case, Andre is stuck in traffic when his father starts shouting at him for being a bad driver. This makes me think that Andre might be feeling some level of anxiety or stress because of the situation.

Next, I need to consider the possible emotions that Andre might feel in this situation. Based on the information provided, I can rule out ""amusement"" because there is nothing funny about being yelled at by your father. Similarly, ""disapproval"" doesn't seem like an appropriate emotion to feel in this situation, as it would imply that Andre agrees with his father's criticism.

Now let's focus on the remaining options. ""Unbothered"" seems unlikely given the stress and anxiety that Andre might be experiencing. ""Nervousness"" could be a possibility, but it's not clear if Andre is nervous about the situation itself or about dealing with his father. That leaves us with ""annoyance"" and ""fear.""

Considering the context, it makes sense that Andre might feel annoyed because his father is yelling at him. However, fear is also a valid option because of the potential tension and discomfort that can arise from an uncomfortable situation with a family member.

In conclusion, based on the information provided, the correct answer is (d) ""Annoyance"" and ""Fear."" These emotions are likely due to the stress and anxiety that Andre might be experiencing in this situation.",3,Andre felt amusement because he realized that the person who shouted at him was his father.

Andre was stuck in traffic when someone shouted at him for being a bad driver. He then realized it was his dad. So, now we know that Andre is angry with his father because he thinks he's a bad driver.
Based on this information, I can conclude that Andre would ultimately feel annoyed in this situation.",-1,Andre felt displeased because he didn't want to be criticized by his father.,-1

最终答案：(d)",3,"Clai heard cheers and saw Michi at her graduation ceremony so she knew that Michi must have attended the graduation. So, choice (a) is incorrect because if Michi didn't attend Clai's graduation then Clai wouldn't have seen or heard anything. Choice (b) is also incorrect as it doesn't explain why Clai felt those emotions. Choice (c) is incorrect because even though Clai wasn't expecting to graduate, she still would have felt those emotions had she seen Michi there. Finally, choice (d) is incorrect because it doesn't explain why Clai felt those emotions. The correct answer is choice (b), which states that Clai felt those emotions because she had actually graduated from college.",0,"The fact that Michi couldn't come to graduation means she can't be there to support Clai. This is a sad thing because it means they won't have their usual celebration together. However, when Clai sees Michi at the end of the day, she hears cheering and sees her. So, maybe Michi sent someone else to cheer or did something else to show her support. In this case, Clai might feel delighted.
Therefore, the correct answer is (d) delight.",3,"Clai heard cheers and saw Michi so she knew that Michi must have attended the graduation. She also knew that she was walking down the stage to receive her diploma so she must have graduated from college.
Therefore, the correct answer is (b).",1,"Clai heard a loud cheerer when she was walking down the stage to receive her diploma. She saw Michi who couldn't come to her graduation. This means that Michi is cheering from a distance. So, Clai will be delighted because of seeing Michi.
最终答案：(d)",3,"Clai heard cheers and saw Michi so she knew that Michi must have attended the graduation event. She also knew that she was walking down the stage to receive her diploma which means she must have graduated from college. So, we can eliminate (a), (c) and (d) as they are not true.

The correct answer is (a) Disapproval.,0,"Clai heard cheers when she walked down the stage to receive her diploma. This means that people were cheering for her.

最终答案：（a）。",0,"Clai heard cheers when she walked down the stage to receive her diploma so it means that people around her were happy or excited. It is unlikely that people cheer if they know someone is going to fail. So, we can eliminate (c) because Clai didn't know she was going to graduate until then.

Next, let's consider why people might cheer. Maybe they knew Clai well enough to be happy for her. But since Clai felt hopeless, maybe there was something else going on. We can rule out (b) because it doesn't make sense to feel hopeful or sad after receiving a diploma.

Finally, let's consider (a) and (d). If Michi wasn't attending Clai's graduation, then Clai wouldn't have expected her to be at the graduation. This makes sense because Clai felt disappointed and surprised. The cheers must have come from somewhere else, like other people who weren't expecting Michi to be there either.

Guilt is a feeling of remorse or responsibility for having done something wrong or causing harm to others. Since Alice did not do anything wrong, she should not feel guilty.

In the end, Amy may feel a combination of discomfort, curiosity, and perhaps a little bit of sadness that she can't fully experience her culture through food.
Answer: (d) Fear & Pessimism",3,Amy might consider eating with hands not hygienic because she is unfamiliar with Indian culture and may be worried about cross-contamination.She didn't want to come to this place because she might have felt uncomfortable or unwelcome due to her concerns about the food preparation method.,-1,"Amy is an American woman who has never tried Indian food before. She is with Samira, who wants her to try Indian cuisine. The food arrives and Samira starts eating with her hands. This is something Amy might be uncomfortable with because she is used to using cutlery when eating. Additionally, Samira mentions that the food reminds her of her mother's cooking, which could evoke emotions of nostalgia or connection from Amy.
Based on this information, I believe the correct answer is (d) Fear & Pessimism. Amy may be afraid of trying something new and different, as well as feeling pessimistic about how she will accept the food.",3,Amy might consider eating with hands not hygienic because she is unfamiliar with Indian culture and she might be worried about hygiene.,-1,"Amy is an American woman who has never tried Indian food before.

Based on this information, I can conclude that Amy might feel a bit uncomfortable or nervous because she has never tried Indian food before and doesn't know if she will like it. She might also feel a bit curious or excited to try something new from another culture. However, she probably won't feel disgust or anger because Samira didn't do anything inappropriate.

因此，答案是：
(b)",1,"The correct answer is (d) Disapproval & Anger.

1. Firstly, we need to understand what happened in the story. Lincoln moved to Dubai during Ramadan because of higher salary. This means he has to follow the local culture and religious practices. It is common in some cultures that people do not eat or drink during certain hours of the day like Ramadan. So it seems likely that Lincoln might have been unaware of this practice when suggesting a lunch meeting on his first day.

2. Then, Ali directly said ""no"", which could be interpreted as an indication of disapproval. Maybe Ali thought it was inappropriate to have a meal break during Ramadan.

3. Moreover, Lincoln might feel angry because he did not expect such a negative response. He might also feel sad because he might have felt rejected or ignored.",3,"Ali didn't want to have lunch with him because he was a foreigner and they don't eat meat during Ramadan.

答案：（d）",3,"Ted has won the arm wrestling championship for 7 years in a row. Ricky, who is new to the game, decided to challenge him anyway.

Therefore, the correct answer is (a) Ricky challenged him, regardless of him knowing he would lose.",0,"Ted knows he is unbeatable so he wouldn't be nervous or embarrassed. He also doesn't need to be proud of his win because he did it every year. So we can eliminate (e), (d), and (a) from consideration.
Ted is an expert at arm wrestling which means he knows what he is doing. If he knew he was unbeatable then he might get annoyed if someone else tried to challenge him. But since Ricky didn't know that, Ted wouldn't get annoyed. We can therefore eliminate (f) as an option.

Ted had won the championship for 7 years straight so Ricky couldn't be amused either. This leaves us with two options left; annoyance and pride.
Now let's analyze each option.
Annoyance makes sense because Ricky knew he was going to lose but still decided to try anyways. It could also be because he felt like he wasn't given a fair chance since Ted was much stronger than him.
Pride doesn't make sense here because Ricky knew he was going to lose and he wouldn't be proud of losing.

In this case, Aiden's best friend is not admitting that he/she is wrong but instead saying that he/she is right. This does not make him/her feel embarrassed.
Gratitude is when someone is grateful or appreciative of something that has been given or done. While it might seem like an interesting choice at first, it doesn't really fit the context.
Amusement is when someone finds something to be amusing or entertaining. It also doesn't seem to fit the situation since it involves finding the conversation to be funny rather than emotional.
Disappointment is when someone is disappointed or frustrated because they have not received or achieved what they expected or wanted. Since Aiden's best friend is not admitting that he/she is wrong, there is no disappointment here.
Annoyance is when someone becomes annoyed or irritated because of something that has happened or is happening. It seems like a reasonable choice considering the constant repetition of ""You're so right and I'm so wrong!"" However, it still doesn't quite fit the context.

Disappointment is a feeling of sadness or disappointment caused by not getting what one wanted or expected. It seems to be a possible answer, as Aiden might feel disappointed when he realizes that his friend will not change her mind and they will continue to argue.
Annoyance is a feeling of irritation and displeasure. It does not seem to fit in this situation, as Aiden is not annoyed with his friend but rather with the argument itself.

It can be shown through actions like helping others, being supportive, or offering comfort. In this situation, where Ben is going through financial difficulties and struggling to find a job, it seems unlikely that he would feel any kind of caring emotion towards himself or his family.

Jealousy is an emotion that usually arises when someone feels envious of another person's success, wealth, or happiness. This doesn't seem to be a relevant emotion in this situation either, as Ben is facing financial difficulties, not competing with anyone else.

Embarrassment is a feeling of shame or discomfort caused by a situation where someone has done something embarrassing or is placed in an awkward situation. While Ben might feel some level of embarrassment due to his financial difficulties, it's not clear how this would affect his emotions overall.

Curiosity is a desire to know or learn more about something new or different. Again, this emotion doesn't seem to be relevant in this situation, as Ben is primarily focused on dealing with his own financial difficulties rather than interested in learning about others.

Disappointment is a feeling of sadness or disappointment caused by the failure of an expectation or hope. While it's possible that Ben might feel some degree of disappointment in himself for failing to keep his financial promises to his family, it's not the primary emotion that he would feel in this situation.

Remorse is a feeling of regret or guilt for having done something wrong or causing harm to others. In this case, while Ben might feel some level of remorse for the financial difficulties he's caused himself and his family, it's not the primary emotion that he would feel in this situation.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is (c) Disappointment & Remorse. These emotions are the most likely outcomes for Ben in this situation, as he faces financial difficulties and struggles to find a job while also feeling responsible for the consequences of his actions.",2,"The company was bankrupt because of COVID-19.
So, the correct answer is (e).",4,"Embarrassment is feeling uncomfortable or embarrassed because of a situation that is perceived as being exposed to public view or judgment. In this case, he didn't want his family to know so he felt embarrassed.
Caring is showing concern or attention for someone else's feelings, needs, or well-being. He was worried about his family and how they will react when they find out.
Remorse is a strong feeling of regret or guilt for having done something wrong or causing harm to another person or thing. He might have regrets about what happened but it doesn't mean he feels remorseful every moment.
So the correct answer should be (b), ""Embarrassment & Caring"".",1,"The company was bankrupt because of Ben's failure to keep it from bankruptcy. He couldn't find a new job because his company went bankrupt.

So the correct answer should include these emotions.

Curiosity is a desire to know more about something new or different.
Oblivious means unaware or unknowing.
Disappointment is feeling let down or disappointed when something does not meet one's expectations or hopes.
