Embarrassment occurs when someone feels humiliated or ashamed because of a mistake, a failure, or an unpleasant situation. In this case, Albert may feel embarrassed since he did not make it into the top 5 despite his hard work and effort. However, there is no evidence that he cheated or did anything improper, so guilt is not appropriate. He may also feel disappointed but not disapproving of himself as he did everything he could.

- Firstly, because Albert did not achieve what he wanted, he may be feeling disappointed or frustrated.
- Secondly, because he failed to meet his father's expectations, he might feel guilty.

(e) Sadness is not a valid option either because Momo does not appear to be sad during her dancing session.

In conclusion, the correct answer should be (a) Anger.",0,"She felt angry because of the client refusing her work multiple times, resulting in her getting reprimanded by her boss.

Amusement is a feeling of pleasure or interest caused by something that is funny or interesting. Dancing can be fun, but it doesn't seem like something that would make Momo feel amusement specifically in this context.
Hopelessness is a feeling of despair or loss of hope. It seems unlikely that Momo would feel hopeless after dancing, especially since dancing is an escape for her.
Sadness is a feeling of sadness or unhappiness. While Momo may have been feeling sad or upset due to her stress, dancing wouldn't necessarily make her feel any better. She might feel some relief, but not necessarily sadness.
Guilt is a feeling of remorse or self-reproach for doing something wrong or for failing to do something right. It doesn't seem like Momo would feel guilty after dancing, even though it might not solve her problems completely.

She also felt grateful that she could explain herself and apologize.,0,"Jessica was late to the date because she stopped to help a family on the way.
最终的答案是：
(a)",0,"Guilt is an emotion that someone feels because they have done something wrong or have failed to do something they should have done. In this case, Jessica is late because she is helping a family stuck on the highway. She did not do anything wrong, so guilt is not an appropriate emotion.
Trust is an emotion that someone feels when they believe that another person will act in a way that is beneficial to both of them. In this case, Jessica is apologizing for being late, which indicates that she believes that her behavior has not been in the best interest of Roger. Therefore, trust is not an appropriate emotion.
Gratitude is an emotion that someone feels when they appreciate the actions of another person. In this case, Jessica is apologizing for being late, which indicates that she appreciates Roger's patience and understanding. Therefore, gratitude is an appropriate emotion.
Amusement is an emotion that someone feels when they find something funny or amusing. In this case, there is no indication that Roger is finding the situation amusing. Therefore, amusement is not an appropriate emotion.
Disapproval is an emotion that someone feels when they believe that another person's actions are unacceptable or wrong. In this case, Jessica is not doing anything wrong; she is just late due to helping a family stuck on the highway. Therefore, disapproval is not an appropriate emotion.
Based on our reasoning, the correct answer is (c) Gratitude.",2,"Jessica apologizes to Roger for being late and explains that she helped a family stuck on the highway. This means that she was not late because she wanted to be or because she did not want to help the family. Therefore, it is unlikely that she also thought of breaking up with Roger at the same time.

Choice (a) is incorrect because she was late because she stopped to help a family on the way. If she had left them, she wouldn't have been late.
Choice (b) is also incorrect because she didn't want to end the date early. She wanted to go out with Roger.
Choice (c) is incorrect because she shouldn't have agreed to go out with someone who would make her feel guilty for helping others.
Choice (d) is incorrect because she had to leave the family on the highway to come to the date. If she had helped them, she wouldn't have made it on time.
The correct answer is Choice (a): She was late to the date because she stopped to help a family on the way.",0,Jessica felt guilty because she was late and she knew that Roger was waiting for her.

Answer: (c) Sentimental",2,The watch belonged to his father because he stumbled upon an old wristwatch that his father used to wear when Josh was only a child.,0,"Josh stumbled upon an old wristwatch that his father used to wear when he was just a child. The watch is an ordinary device, but it has been scratched and worn over time. Despite its condition, Josh decided not to throw it away.
The emotion of curiosity may arise from the fact that Josh does not know how his father came to own such a watch or what its history might be. However, this information would not be particularly relevant to the situation at hand.
Disgust is not an appropriate emotion to feel in this context, as the watch itself is not disgusting or unpleasant in any way.
Sentimental emotions can arise from memories associated with the watch, as Josh might remember his father wearing it during his childhood. This could lead him to feel a sense of nostalgia or wistfulness.
Nervousness is not an appropriate emotion to feel in this situation, as there is no reason for Josh to be anxious or worried about the watch.
Sadness is also not an appropriate emotion to feel in this context, as the watch itself is not associated with any negative events or losses.
Finally, joy can arise from the discovery of the watch, as it provides a positive reminder of his father and their shared history.

In this case, Vivian's shaking her legs may be considered inappropriate because it could be seen as a distraction or a lack of attention to her work.
Disappointment is a feeling of unhappiness or disappointment caused by the failure to achieve or obtain what one hopes for or expects. Since Vivian was working on her project, any disturbance or disruption could cause her disappointment.
Guilt is a feeling of remorse or shame caused by the awareness of having done something wrong or immoral. If Vivian realized that her shaking legs were causing trouble or inconvenience to others, she might feel guilty.
Joy is a feeling of great happiness or delight, while gratitude is a feeling of appreciation or thankfulness. These emotions do not seem to fit the context of the situation.

Disappointment is a negative emotional state resulting from an expectation not being met or a desired outcome not occurring. In this context, Vivian might feel disappointed because she felt that her behavior was inappropriate and it may have interfered with her work. She might have wanted to focus on her project but her leg shaking made it difficult for her to do so.

Answer: (e)",4,"Embarrassment is an emotional state that occurs when someone feels exposed or humiliated in public. In this case, Vivian might feel embarrassed because she was shaking her leg in the lab and it could be seen as inappropriate behavior.
Disappointment is a feeling of sadness or disappointment caused by the failure to achieve or obtain something expected or desired. Since Vivian didn't want to cause any trouble or inconvenience, she might feel disappointed because she knew that her behavior was not appropriate.
Joy is a positive emotional state characterized by happiness and excitement. Vivian might feel joy because she realized that Jane cared enough to ask if she was okay despite the unusual behavior.
Gratitude is a feeling of appreciation and thanks. Vivian might feel grateful because she realized that Jane's concern showed that they had a good relationship and that Jane was a good friend.
Pride is a feeling of satisfaction and self-esteem that comes from achieving or accomplishing something. This emotion does not fit in this situation.
Guilt is a negative emotional state that results from recognizing that one has done something wrong or immoral. While Vivian might feel guilty for causing any discomfort or inconvenience to Jane, this is not the primary emotion that she will ultimately feel.
Based on our analysis, the correct answer is (b) Embarrassment & Guilt.",1,"Vivian is doing her project in the lab. She is focused on her work so she doesn't notice Jane approaching her. When Jane asks her if she is okay, it might make Vivian feel embarrassed because she was not focused on what she should have been focusing on.

In this case, Vivian might feel embarrassed because she was shaking her leg in the lab while working on her project.

Guilt is a feeling of remorse or shame that arises when someone believes they have done something wrong or violated a moral code. In this case, Vivian might feel guilty because she knew that shaking her leg was not appropriate behavior in the lab.
Gratitude is a feeling of appreciation or thanksgiving for something good or helpful. In this case, Vivian might feel grateful because Jane noticed her behavior and asked if she was okay, which showed that Jane cared about her well-being.
Pride is a feeling of satisfaction or accomplishment that arises when someone is proud of their achievements or qualities. This situation does not seem like it would lead to pride.

Disappointment is feeling let down or disappointed about something. Vivian didn't feel disappointed because she wasn't disappointed in herself or anything else.
Guilt is feeling bad about something you did or didn't do. Vivian didn't feel guilty either because she knew she wasn't doing anything wrong.
Joy is feeling happy or excited. Vivian might have felt joy from being noticed and recognized by Jane.
Pride is feeling proud of yourself or your actions. Vivian could feel pride if she thought her shaking her leg was funny or interesting enough for Jane to notice.
Gratitude is feeling grateful or appreciative. Vivian could feel gratitude towards Jane for noticing her and asking if she was okay.

This means she is feeling calm and happy despite receiving love letters every day.
Therefore, the correct answer is (b).",1,"Annoyance is the feeling of being irritated or annoyed by something or someone. In this case, Joanne receives love letters from anonymous admirers every day, which may be annoying because she doesn't know who they are and it may be bothersome to deal with them.
Therefore, the correct answer is (b) Annoyance.",1,"Joanne received love letters from anonymous admirers every day. This made her feel annoyed because she wanted to find a partner who she can trust and be open with.
Therefore, the correct answer is (a) she doesn't find anyone likable in her school.",0,"The letters were coming from an anonymous admirer so they couldn't be from someone she knew. This means there is no way for her to know if these people even like her as a person or just her looks. So it seems unlikely that she would feel any kind of admiration towards them.
Annoyance is a reasonable emotion because she doesn't know who is sending the letters and it might be annoying to have to deal with this every day.
Joy is also a reasonable emotion to feel but it seems unlikely given the situation described.
Excitement is also a reasonable emotion to feel but again it seems unlikely given the situation described.
Pride is also a reasonable emotion to feel but it seems unlikely given the situation described.
Guilt is also a reasonable emotion to feel but it seems unlikely given the situation described.

This means they must be admiring her personality as well as her appearance. If she didn't want this, she could just tell them to stop sending her letters. But she doesn't do that. So it seems she likes the attention and admiration.
Answer: (b) She enjoys having many admirers",1,"The person who sent the letters is anonymous so it can't be admiration because admiration requires some form of recognition or knowledge of the person being admired. It also can't be excitement because excitement usually involves something new or unexpected happening. The letters were sent to Joanne but she doesn't know who sent them so it can't be pride either. Finally, if the letters were coming from someone she knew then guilt might be an option but since she doesn't know who sent them it can't be guilt. So the correct answer has to be one of the options that involve knowing who sent the letters.
Answer: (b) Annoyance",1,She is annoyed because she does not want to be in a relationship without knowing who the other person is.,-1,"The letters were coming from anonymous admirers. This means that they don't know each other well enough to be considered friends or acquaintances. They also don't know Joanne well enough to understand her needs and wants.

He thanked those who voted for him because he believed they did it honestly. So choice (d) is incorrect.
He felt guilt and delight at the same time. Guilt because he knew he should not have done something wrong but delighted because he won the election.

- Option (c): He knew that he would win the election due to his friends' help & He didn't know what the results would be. This is also possible but not the only explanation for why he might feel awe.

Answer: (b)",1,"Andie sees that Rosy looks pale after eating some chocolate. This means that Rosy's health is not good because her blood sugar is low. So Andie might be feeling guilty because she thinks she is responsible for Rosy's health problem.

From this information, we can conclude that Andie felt guilt because she knew that she was responsible for what happened to Rosy. She could have been worried about her friend, but since she knew that Rosy was okay, this choice is not likely. Making a joke to lighten the mood is also unlikely because Andie doesn't seem to be trying to make things better.

Now, he is finally ready to break up with Janice because he knows that he can't continue living this lie anymore. He knows that he has to tell Janice the truth, and he knows that she will be hurt and angry. But he also knows that it is the right thing to do.

So, while he might be feeling a lot of sadness and guilt about breaking up with Janice, he is also feeling a sense of relief.

Now let's look at the choices.
(a) Caring- This seems unlikely because if he really cared about Janice, he wouldn't have been cheating on her for 2 years.
(b) Oblivious- This also seems unlikely because if he really didn't know how Janice felt about him, he wouldn't have been able to cheat on her for 2 years without her knowing.
(c) Guilt- This seems possible because he has been lying to Janice for 2 years and will be breaking up with her so that he can be with another woman. This could lead to guilt.
(d) Embarrassment- This also seems possible because he will be breaking up with Janice after cheating on her for 2 years. This could lead to embarrassment.
(e) Admiration- This seems unlikely because he is cheating on his girlfriend and planning to break up with her so that he can be with another woman.
(f) Joy- This seems unlikely because he is cheating on his girlfriend and planning to break up with her so that he can be with another woman.
