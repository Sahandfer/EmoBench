Andre was stuck in traffic because of someone who shouted at him for being a bad driver. He went out of his car to confront this person, and then he found out that this person was his father.

Now let's analyze each choice:
- (a) Disapproval: This is an emotional reaction based on the belief that something is wrong or unacceptable. In our case, Andre's father disapproves of his driving skills. It could be a possible answer if we consider that Andre might feel some kind of rejection from his father because of this accusation.
- (b) Amusement: This emotion is caused by something that is seen as funny or interesting. In our case, there is no humor element in the story.
- (c) Annoyance: This is an emotional reaction caused by irritation or frustration. In our case, Andre might feel annoyed because his father accused him of being a bad driver without any evidence.
- (d) Nervousness: This emotion is caused by anxiety or stress. In our case, Andre might feel nervous because he had to confront his father in a tense situation.
- (e) Fear: This emotion is caused by the expectation of harm or danger. In our case, there is no threat or danger involved in the story.
- (f) Unbothered: This emotion is the opposite of nervousness; it means that someone is not affected by stress or anxiety. In our case, Andre might not feel unbothered because he has to deal with a situation where his father accuses him of being a bad driver.
After analyzing all the choices, the best answer seems to be (c) Annoyance.",2,Andre felt annoyed because he didn't want to be stuck in traffic or have someone shout at him. He also felt emotional because the person shouting at him turned out to be his father.,-1,"The most important thing is to understand the context and background information of the story so as to better judge the emotions of the protagonist.

It means feeling empathy and concern for others. In this case, Ben felt concerned about the homeless man's well-being and wanted to help him.
Embarrassment is a negative emotional state caused by social discomfort or embarrassment. This does not fit the context because Ben did not feel embarrassed when helping the homeless man.
Disgust is a negative emotional state caused by something repulsive or disgusting. This does not fit the context either because Ben did not feel disgusted when helping the homeless man.
Hopeless is a negative emotional state caused by despair or loss of hope. This does not fit the context because Ben did not feel hopeless after helping the homeless man.

Firstly, we know that Ben helped the homeless man because he felt caring. This shows that he has a good heart and cares about others.

Jealousy is a feeling of envy or resentment caused by the thought of another person having something that the person feeling jealous wants or desires. In this case, Elise felt jealous when she found out that Damon was in a relationship with someone else, but she did not want that relationship, so it is not appropriate to say that she felt jealousy.
Anticipation is the feeling of excitement or pleasure in anticipation of something that is going to happen in the future. Since Elise already knew about Damon's relationship, there is no anticipation here.
Sentimental is related to emotions or memories. It is not clear if this is relevant to the situation described.

Relief is a feeling of happiness or safety brought about by the removal of anxiety or trouble.
So, Delight & Relief is the correct answer.",-1,She got a job offer from one of her favorite companies & She finally got a job offer after getting many rejections,-1,"Delight is a feeling of great happiness or satisfaction because of something good or exciting happening. Relief is a feeling of being freed from anxiety or worry. In this case, Susan was very happy when she got the job, so delight is a possible emotion. She felt relieved because she no longer had to worry about finding a job, which is also a possible emotion.

Relief and embarrassment can both happen, but they are not necessarily connected. Embarrassment is a feeling of shame or humiliation, usually caused by a situation where someone has done something embarrassing or been caught doing something wrong. In this case, it is unlikely that Susan would feel embarrassed because she was crying happily.

Disappointment is a feeling of sadness or disappointment caused by something not turning out as expected or desired. This situation does not seem to fit the description of disappointment because Susan was happy about getting the job.

Hopeless is a feeling of total loss of hope or confidence, usually caused by a situation that seems impossible to fix. This situation is not hopeless because Susan still had hope and confidence in herself even though she faced numerous rejections.

Relief and embarrassment are two different emotions. Relief is a feeling of being freed from something that was causing trouble or anxiety, while embarrassment is a feeling of discomfort or shame caused by a situation where someone feels exposed or humiliated.
Embarrassment and nervousness are two different emotions. Embarrassment is a feeling of discomfort or shame caused by a situation where someone feels exposed or humiliated, while nervousness is a feeling of anxiety or tension caused by worry or fear.
Disappointment is a feeling of sadness or disappointment caused by something not turning out as expected or desired. In this case, Susan felt disappointed when she first heard that she didn't get the job, but later felt delighted when she found out that she got the job.
Hopeless is a feeling of total loss of hope or confidence.
