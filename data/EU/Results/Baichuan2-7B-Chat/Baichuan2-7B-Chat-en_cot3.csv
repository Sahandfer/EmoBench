"['Disapproval', 'Fear', 'Annoyance', 'Unbothered', 'Amusement', 'Nervousness']",4,"['He loves traffic', 'He enjoys confrontations', 'The person shouting at him turned out to be his dad', 'He enjoys being called a bad driver.']",2,"Andre is initially annoyed because of the traffic jam. When he realizes it's his father, he feels fear or anxiety as he might get into an argument with his father. He also feels nervousness since he doesn't know how his father will react. Finally, he might feel some amusement due to the irony of the situation.
Therefore, the correct answer is (e) Amusement.",4,"He loves traffic because it is an unnecessary waste of time.
He enjoys a confrontation because it is an unnecessary waste of energy.
The person who shouted at him turned out to be his father, which is not fun.
He enjoys being called a bad driver because it is an unnecessary insult.",0,"The most important thing is to analyze the information provided in the problem. The main idea is that Andre was stuck in traffic, and his father shouted at him because he thought he was a bad driver. This means that Andre will be angry or disappointed with his father's behavior.
Based on this analysis, we can conclude that Andre's final emotions will be anger or disappointment.
Therefore, the correct answer is (a), disapproval.",0,Andre felt disapproval because he was confronted by his father who shouted at him for being a bad driver.,-1,"The most important thing is to understand the context and the main character's emotions. The story tells us that Andre was stuck in traffic and was yelled at by his father. This means that there must be some emotional reactions in this situation.
From the given choices, we can find that (a) disapproval, (b) fear, (c) annoyance, (d) unbothered, (e) amusement, and (f) nervousness.
We know that Andre felt annoyed because his father yelled at him. So, the correct answer should be (c) Annoyance.",2,"Andre felt annoyed because he didn't want to be stuck in traffic and also because someone was accusing him of being a bad driver without even knowing him. Moreover, he felt angry because he had to deal with an unpleasant situation with his father.",-1,Andre felt disaproval because his father was accusing him of being a bad driver.,-1,Andre felt nervous because he didn't know how his father would react.,-1,"The first thing I need to do is understand the situation. Andre was stuck in traffic when someone started shouting at him for being a bad driver. He then realized it was his dad. So now we know that Andre was stuck in traffic, he was yelled at by his dad, and he confronted his dad.
Now let's think about the emotions that could potentially come up in this situation. There's disapproval, fear, annoyance, unbothered, amusement, and nervousness. Let's break these down one by one.
- Disapproval: This is when someone doesn't agree with or like something. In this case, Andre might feel disapproval if he thinks his dad is wrong about him being a bad driver. But since he confronted his dad, it seems like he doesn't agree with what his dad is saying.
- Fear: This is an intense, often physical, reaction to something that causes anxiety or worry. It doesn't really make sense in this situation because Andre isn't afraid of his dad.
- Annoyance: This is when someone is irritated or annoyed by something. It also doesn't really fit in this situation because Andre is more likely to be upset with his dad than annoyed.
- Unbothered: This is when someone isn't bothered or affected by something. It also doesn't really make sense in this situation because Andre would definitely be affected by his dad yelling at him.
- Amusement: This is when someone finds something funny or amusing. It doesn't fit in this situation because Andre wouldn't be laughing at his dad yelling at him.
- Nervousness: This is when someone is feeling anxious or nervous. It also doesn't really fit in this situation because Andre isn't nervous about his dad yelling at him.
Based on all of this, the only emotion that could potentially come up in this situation is anger. Andre might be angry with his dad for yelling at him, especially since they're related. So the answer is (c) Annoyance.",2,Andre felt annoyed because he didn't like being accused of being a bad driver.,-1

Pride is a feeling of satisfaction or self-respect caused by a person's own achievements, qualities, or actions. You cannot be proud if someone else wins the award.
Admiration is a feeling of deep respect and wonder for someone or something. If James won the award, you could admire him for his efforts.

Guilt is a negative emotional state that arises from the awareness of having done something wrong or immoral. Vivian might feel guilty because she knew that shaking her leg during work was not appropriate.
Joy is a positive emotional state caused by happiness or satisfaction. Vivian might feel joy because she enjoyed shaking her leg or because she felt satisfied with her work.
Gratitude is a positive emotional state caused by the receipt or appreciation of a favor or benefit. Since Vivian might appreciate Jane's concern, she might feel grateful.
Pride is a positive emotional state caused by a sense of achievement, accomplishment, or superiority. Although Vivian might feel proud of her work, it is not relevant in this context.
Therefore, the correct answer is (b) Embarrassment & Guilt.",1,"She received a compliment from Jane & She didn't want people noticing her legs
Answer: (a) She received a compliment from Jane & She didn't want people noticing her legs",0,"Embarrassment is an uncomfortable feeling that occurs when someone notices something inappropriate or unusual about themselves. In this case, Vivian might feel embarrassed because she was shaking her leg in public (the lab), which is not appropriate behavior there.
Disappointment is a feeling of sadness or frustration caused by the failure to achieve or obtain what one hopes or expects. Vivian may also feel disappointed because she did not realize that her behavior was disturbing others.
Therefore, the correct answer is (b) - Embarrassment & Guilt.",1,"Vivian is embarrassed because she is doing something that is considered inappropriate in public.
因此，答案是：
(a)",0,"Embarrassment is an emotional state that occurs when someone feels exposed or humiliated in public. In this case, Vivian might feel embarrassed because she was shaking her leg in the lab, which could be considered inappropriate behavior in a professional setting.
Disappointment is a feeling of sadness or disappointment caused by the failure to achieve or obtain something expected or desired. In this situation, there is no reason for Vivian to feel disappointed, as she was simply having fun or focusing by shaking her leg.
Guilt is a feeling of remorse or shame caused by the awareness of having done something wrong or harmful. While Vivian might feel some guilt for shaking her leg in the lab, it is unlikely that she would feel significant guilt due to her behavior alone.
Joy is a positive emotional state characterized by happiness or exuberance. Vivian might feel joy if she found herself laughing or enjoying herself while shaking her leg. However, there is no evidence in the scenario that her behavior led to any joyous outcome.
Pride is a feeling of satisfaction or accomplishment derived from one's own actions or achievements. Vivian might feel pride if she was able to complete her project while shaking her leg, but there is no indication in the scenario that this was the case.
Gratitude is a feeling of appreciation or thanksgiving for a favor or kindness received. While Vivian might feel grateful for Jane's concern, her shaking her leg is not a favor or kindness that would lead to gratitude.
Based on these considerations, the correct answer is (e) Pride & Gratitude. Although Vivian might feel some embarrassment and guilt due to her behavior, her project likely went well, leading her to feel pride and gratitude for Jane's concern.",4,She received a compliment from Jane & She didn't want people noticing her legs because she doesn't want to be judged on her appearance.,-1,"Embarrassment is an uncomfortable feeling that comes from being noticed in a social situation where one should not be noticed. In this case, Vivian was doing something unusual (shaking her leg), so it could be assumed that she felt embarrassed.
Disappointment is a negative emotional state caused by the failure to achieve or experience something expected or desired. Since there is no indication that Vivian did not achieve anything she expected or desired, we can assume that she does not feel disappointed.
Guilt is a negative emotional state caused by the awareness of doing something wrong or causing harm to others. There is no indication that Vivian did anything wrong or harmed anyone, so we can assume that she does not feel guilty.
Joy is a positive emotional state caused by happiness or satisfaction. Vivian might have been happy or satisfied with what she was doing at the time, but since she was also embarrassed, joy cannot be the only emotion she felt.
Gratitude is a positive emotional state caused by appreciation or thanksgiving. It seems unlikely that Vivian appreciated or thanked someone for shaking her leg, so we can assume that she does not feel grateful.
Pride is a positive emotional state caused by a sense of achievement or superiority. While Vivian might have been proud of herself for doing her project well, there is no indication that this happened while she was shaking her leg, so pride is not an appropriate answer.
Based on our analysis, the only possible emotion Vivian could feel in this situation is embarrassment. She might also feel gratitude because Jane asked her if she was okay, which could be interpreted as a sign of care and concern. However, this is not a necessary part of the scenario, so we can safely say that the correct answer is (b) Embarrassment & Guilt.",1,"Vivian is embarrassed because she is doing something that is considered inappropriate in the lab environment (shaking her leg).

So, the final emotion would be (b) Embarrassment & Pride.",1,"The worker complimented her glowy skin and recommended a product that could maintain her skin. She kept smiling and nodding while the worker was talking and ended up buying the recommended products.
So, the correct answer should be related to her behavior when the worker was talking.
From the given choices, (d) She was hiding the fact that she didn't know Korean from the worker is not relevant because there is no evidence that she knew or did not know Korean.
Choice (e) While being a Korean descent, she couldn't understand Korean & She wasn't interested in the product but didn't want to disappoint the worker also doesn't make sense because if she couldn't understand Korean, it wouldn't matter whether she bought the product or not.
Therefore, the correct answer should be one of the following options:
(a), (b), or (c)",0,"The worker complimented her glowy skin and recommended a product that could maintain her skin. This means she is proud of her skin.

If she had no idea what he was saying, she wouldn't have known if it was good or bad. But she smiled and nodded, so she must have understood him. So, option (d) can be eliminated.
She then bought the product. This means that she was interested in the product, so options (a), (c), and (e) can also be eliminated.
Since she didn't want to disappoint the worker, she might buy the product even if she didn't need it, but this doesn't explain why she felt pride or embarrassment. Option (f) can also be eliminated.
So, the correct answer is option (b).",1,"The worker complimented Joeun's glowy skin and recommended a product that could maintain her skin. This means that she felt proud because it shows that her skin is healthy and beautiful.

So, we can conclude that Joeun did not have any negative emotion like embarrassment or hopelessness because she smiled and nodded when the worker was talking.
Therefore, the correct answer should be one of the options that does not include ""embarrassment"" or ""hopeless"".
From the above explanation, it can be seen that option (a), option (f), and option (g) all contain ""embarrassment"" or ""hopeless"", so they are eliminated.

Option (c) contains ""while being a Korean descent,"" which means that Joeun cannot understand Korean, but there is no evidence that she felt embarrassed or helpless. So, this option is eliminated.
