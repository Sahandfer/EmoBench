However, as I started discussing the questions with my friends, I realized that I had not done well on the last question. I felt a sense of annoyance and guilt because I had let myself down.

As I continued to discuss the question with my friends, I suddenly came up with a solution. This brought me a sense of relief because I had overcome the challenge.

In addition, I felt a sense of pride because I had been able to think critically and come up with a solution.

Therefore, the emotions I would ultimately feel in this situation are relief, pride, and nervousness. So the correct answer is (a) Relief & Pride & Nervousness.",0,(c) I had difficulty solving the last question & I doubted my own abilities & I only found the solution after the exam was over.,2,"First of all, I answered most of the questions in the exam in a short amount of time and was sure of my answers.

Then, I spent the rest of the exam on the last question and came up with a solution only after coming out of the exam hall. This situation would make me feel proud of myself for being able to solve the question despite the pressure.

However, since I spent a lot of time on the last question, I might also feel some nervousness. But overall, the relief outweighs the nervousness.

So, the correct answer is (a) Relief & Pride & Nervousness.",0,(a) I had the ability to solve the question but didn't think of it during the exam & I found the solution to the problem that I couldn't figure out before & I only found the solution after the exam was over.,0,"First, I need to analyze the situation and understand what happened.

Based on this analysis, I can排除 options (b), (d), and (f) because they include emotions that are not related to the situation, such as annoyance and guilt.

Next, I need to determine the emotions I would feel when I finally came up with a solution for the last question. In this situation, I would feel relief because I was able to find a solution, but I would also feel pride because I was able to overcome the challenge and come up with a solution.

So, relief and pride cannot be the emotions in this situation.

Next, let's consider the remaining options:

Option (a) - Relief & Pride & Nervousness:Relief is a possible emotion because the person was well prepared and confident about their answers. Pride could also be a possible emotion if the person felt they had done well on the exam. However, nervousness is not a likely emotion in this situation because the person was confident and had answers for most of the questions.

Option (e) - Remorse & Pride & Nervousness: Remorse is not a likely emotion because the person was well prepared and confident about their answers. Pride could be a possible emotion if the person felt they had done well on the exam. Nervousness is also not a likely emotion because the person was confident and had answers for most of the questions.

Option (f) - Remorse & Relief & Annoyance: Remorse is not a likely emotion because the person was well prepared and confident about their answers. Relief is a possible emotion because the person was able to come up with a solution for the last question. Annoyance is not a likely emotion because the person was confident and had answers for most of the questions.

Option (c) - Remorse & Annoyance & Pride: Remorse is not a likely emotion because the person was well prepared and confident about their answers. Annoyance is not a likely emotion because the person was confident and had answers for most of the questions. Pride could be a possible emotion if the person felt they had done well on the exam.

Option (d) - Annoyance & Guilt & Pride: Annoyance is not a likely emotion because the person was confident and had answers for most of the questions. Guilt is not a likely emotion because the person was well prepared and confident about their answers. Pride could be a possible emotion if the person felt they had done well on the exam.

After analyzing the options, the most likely emotions in this situation are relief and pride, so the correct answer is (a).",0,(a) I had the ability to solve the question but didn't think of it during the exam & I found the solution to the problem that I couldn't figure out before & I only found the solution after the exam was over.,0,"First of all, I would feel relieved that I was able to answer most of the questions correctly.

Now, let's analyze the given options:

(b) This option is not relevant to the situation. Damon's emotions are not related to Elise's memory of his birthday.

But there is more to the situation. As a loyal friend, Damon would not want to hurt Elise's feelings or damage their friendship. So he would also feel hopeless about the future of their relationship with her. This brings us to option (b) Surprise & Anger.

Now, let's consider the other options. Option (c) Surprise & Pride doesn't make sense since pride would not be a likely emotion in this situation. Option (d) Hopeless & Pride is also not a suitable choice since pride would not be a reason for Damon to feel hopeless. Option (e) Surprise & Guilt is similar to option (a) but the order of the emotions is incorrect. Option (f) Guilt & Disapproval doesn't accurately describe Damon's emotions since he is not disapproving of Elise's feelings.

Since Weili was unfamiliar with the German movie timings, she might have felt anxious or embarrassed when she arrived late for the movie. This is because she may have been worried about being late and potentially causing inconvenience or discomfort for Samantha. However, Samantha didn't react when she arrived, which might have contributed to Weili's embarrassment.

Option (b) could be a possibility, as Ling might not know that Americans like to order their own food and Lucia took a dish for herself, whereas all the dishes were supposed to be shared. In this case, Ling might feel disappointed or left out because she did not expect Lucia to order for herself, but it is not clear if she would feel disapproval or sadness.

Gratitude is the emotion of appreciation for a person or thing, and in this scenario, it is clear that his students have put effort into creating a meaningful mural for him, which shows their appreciation for his years of teaching.

(c) Excitement - Andrew would not feel excited about fracturing his leg, as it would not be a positive experience.

Therefore, the correct answer is (c) Relief & Guilt.",2,"First, we need to understand that Sara had decided to quit her job due to the shift to the 13th floor.
Next, we need to consider the emotions that might arise from this situation.
Relief is the feeling of being free from a difficult situation or responsibility.
Guilt is the feeling of being sorry or ashamed for something.
Now, let's consider the given options:

(a) Sara didn't want to be that high in the building.
This option doesn't necessarily imply any emotions, so it's not the best choice.

(b) Sara was scared of the potential elevator ride.
This option could be a reason for Sara to feel anxious or nervous, but it doesn't directly relate to the guilt emotion.

(c) Sara had found a much better job.
This option implies a positive outcome, so it's not related to the guilt emotion.

(d) Sara had a superstition about the number 13.
This option could be the reason for Sara to feel guilty about quitting her job, as she had made a decision based on her superstition.

Based on the above analysis, the best choice is option (d). Sara felt guilty because she had made a decision based on her superstition, and she might feel ashamed of it.

Andie feels bad because she scared Rosy by grabing a piece of chocolate. She probably regrets her action and feels guilty for it. The fact that Rosy's blood sugar got low suggests that Andie's joke or action was not appropriate, and it could have had a negative impact on the situation.

(b) She was making a joke to lighten the mood.

This is not the most appropriate choice. While Andie may have intended to lighten the mood with her joke, her action ultimately caused Rosy to become scared. So this option is not correct.

(c) She is worried about her friend.

This is a possible choice, but it is not the most appropriate one. While Andie may be worried about Rosy's well-being, her joke or action was not helpful in this situation. So this option is not correct.

(d) She didn't bring any chocolates for Rosy.

6.  Janice would feel caring towards Tom, as she cares about him and wants to make things right.

Now let's look at the choices:

(a) He anticipates having joy being with another woman but has to break up with Janice.

This choice implies that Tom is aware of the fact that he is planning to cheat on Janice and then break up with her. This is the most likely reason for Tom to feel emotions in this situation.

(b) He is looking forward to marry Janice.

This choice implies that Tom is still in a positive relationship with Janice and is looking forward to their future together. However, the fact that he is planning to cheat on her and then break up with her makes this choice unlikely.

(c) He doesn't know Janice knows about his cheating.

This choice implies that Tom is not aware that Janice has discovered his cheating. However, the fact that he is planning to break up with her means that he must be aware that she has some knowledge of his infidelity.

(d) Janice supports his decision for breaking up.

This choice implies that Janice is aware of Tom\'s cheating and still supports his decision to break up with her. However, this is not consistent with the scenario, as it implies that Janice is aware of the harm he is causing her and still supports him.

Since Daniel was discussing his nervousness about asking Janet to the prom, it implies that he is unsure about the outcome and might be anxious about it.

Now, let's analyze the choices:

(b) Joy - There is no indication in the scenario that joy is the emotion in question.
(c) Disapproval - There is no indication in the scenario that disapproval is the emotion in question.

Next, we consider the fact that Daniel is planning to ask his childhood friend, Lisa, to the prom instead, which means he is not interested in Janet. This implies that Janet would be disappointed and upset about the situation. Therefore, (c) Disapproval is a likely emotion.

Now, we can eliminate (a) Nervousness as a possible emotion since there is no indication that anyone in the scenario is actually nervous.

We also eliminate (f) Annoyance as a possible emotion since there is no indication that anyone in the scenario is being annoying.

Finally, we can eliminate (e) Gratitude as a possible emotion since there is no indication that anyone in the scenario is expressing gratitude.

Based on this analysis, the most likely emotions in this situation are (c) Disapproval and (f) Annoyance. However, since the question asks for only one emotion, the correct answer is (c) Disapproval.
