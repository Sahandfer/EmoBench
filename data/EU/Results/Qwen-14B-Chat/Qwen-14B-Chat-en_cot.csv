Step 2: Analyze the emotions mentioned in the question.
The emotions mentioned in the question are gratitude.

(a) Gratitude is not a likely emotion if Brian really enjoys the traditional festival and the food, as he would not need to thank the chefs for something he likes.
(b) Gratitude is not a likely emotion if Brian did not want to participate but his friends pressured him to, as he would not be grateful for something he did not want to do.

(d) Gratitude is not a likely emotion if Brian is afraid that he won't be able to finish the pies because they are overly sweet, as he would not be grateful for something he is struggling with.
