(b) Annoyance & Disapproval - Ling may feel annoyed that Lucia did not follow the Chinese custom of letting the host order for the guests, and she may also feel disapproval of Lucia's actions.

(d) Joy & Sadness - It is unlikely that Ling would feel joy and sadness in this situation.
(e) Annoyance & Oblivious - Ling may feel annoyed that Lucia did not follow the Chinese custom, but it is unlikely that she would feel oblivious to Lucia's actions.

Option (b) seems like the most likely answer as it suggests that Ling was expecting the dishes to be shared and was disappointed when Lucia took one for herself. Option (d) also seems plausible as it suggests that Ling was expecting Lucia to speak in Chinese and was disappointed when she didn't. Option (f) also seems like a possible reason for Ling feeling left out, but it does not directly explain why she would feel annoyance and disapproval. Therefore, the most likely answer is (b).",0,"Step 1: Analyze the scenario
In the scenario, Lucia was invited to a dinner gathering by her new Chinese coworker, Ling. When it was time to order, Ling ordered for the whole table and gave back the menu before Lucia could have a look. When the food was served, Lucia looked at the dishes and said ""I can take this one,"" before choosing one of the dishes to eat.

Step 2: Identify the emotions
Based on the scenario, we can identify the following emotions:
- Ling might feel annoyed because she ordered for the whole table and gave back the menu before Lucia could have a look. This suggests that Ling might have wanted Lucia to choose her own food.
- Ling might feel disapproval because Lucia chose a dish without asking or indicating her preference.

Step 3: Match the emotions with the choices
Based on the emotions identified in step 2, we can match them with the choices given:
- (a) Oblivious & Disapproval: This choice does not match the emotions identified in step 2.
- (b) Annoyance & Disapproval: This choice matches the emotions identified in step 2.
- (c) Disapproval & Sadness: This choice does not match the emotions identified in step 2.
- (d) Joy & Sadness: This choice does not match the emotions identified in step 2.
- (e) Annoyance & Oblivious: This choice does not match the emotions identified in step 2.
- (f) Joy & Jealousy: This choice does not match the emotions identified in step 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b) Annoyance & Disapproval.",1,"The scenario states that Ling ordered for the whole table and gave back the menu before Lucia could have a look. This suggests that Ling was the one in charge of ordering the food. When Lucia took a dish for herself without asking Ling, Ling might feel annoyed and disapproved because she was the one who was supposed to order the food and Lucia took a dish without her permission. Additionally, the fact that Lucia didn't thank Ling for the dinner might also contribute to Ling's feelings of being left out. Therefore, the correct answer is (f).",5,"We can eliminate some options based on common sense. For example, it is unlikely that Ling would feel joy and sadness at the same time. It is also unlikely that Ling would feel oblivious and disapproval, as Ling invited Lucia to the dinner and would have noticed that Lucia did not get to choose her own food.
Next, we can consider the remaining options and try to determine which one is the most likely. It is possible that Ling could feel annoyance and disapproval, as Lucia did not allow Ling to choose her food. However, it is also possible that Ling could feel oblivious and disapproval, as Ling may not have realized that Lucia was upset about not getting to choose her own food.
Based on this reasoning, the most likely answer is (a) Oblivious & Disapproval.",0,"The scenario describes a situation where Lucia, a US visitor, was invited to a dinner gathering by her Chinese coworker, Ling.

When the food was served, Lucia looked at the dishes and said ""I can take this one,"" before choosing one of the dishes to eat. The question asks why Ling would feel oblivious and disapproval in this situation.
Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is most likely that Ling feels oblivious and disapproval because Lucia took a dish for herself, whereas all the dishes were supposed to be shared. This is supported by the fact that Ling ordered for the whole table, which suggests that the dishes were meant to be shared among the guests. Additionally, Lucia did not ask Ling about the food choice, which could have indicated that she was not aware of the sharing tradition.

Step 2: Identify the emotions
Based on the scenario, we can infer that Ling might feel some negative emotions due to Lucia's actions. However, we cannot determine the exact emotions without further context.

Step 3: Evaluate the choices
(a) Oblivious & Disapproval: Ling might feel oblivious if she didn't notice Lucia's action, but it's unlikely that she would feel disapproval since she invited Lucia to the dinner.
(b) Annoyance & Disapproval: Ling might feel annoyed and disapprove of Lucia's action since she didn't consult her before choosing a dish.
(c) Disapproval & Sadness: Ling might feel disapproval and sadness if she felt that Lucia didn't respect her decision to order for the whole table.
(d) Joy & Sadness: It's unlikely that Ling would feel joy and sadness in this situation.
(e) Annoyance & Oblivious: Ling might feel annoyed and oblivious if she didn't notice Lucia's action.
(f) Joy & Jealousy: It's unlikely that Ling would feel joy and jealousy in this situation.

John invited his friends, Mark and Alice, over for a game night. Mark arrived early and mentioned that a piece of abstract art on the wall looked like it was made by a child. Alice, who was familiar with the paintings, remained silent and gave a knowing glance to John.

Alice knows that the art on the wall is John's creation, and Mark's comment is not accurate. She also noticed John's reaction to Mark's comment.

Step 3: Determine the emotion(s) Alice would feel
Based on the situation, Alice would feel a mix of emotions. She would feel embarrassed for John because Mark's comment was not accurate and could have hurt John's feelings. She would also feel caring for John because she noticed his reaction and wanted to support him.

Alice, who was familiar with the paintings, remained silent, giving a knowing glance to John.
Next, we need to analyze the question. The question asks us to identify the emotion(s) that Alice would feel in this situation.
Based on the scenario, Alice is familiar with John's paintings and knows that the piece of abstract art on the wall is John's own creation. However, Mark, who is not familiar with John's work, has made a comment that suggests the painting looks like it was made by a child. Alice's silence and knowing glance suggest that she is aware of Mark's comment and its potential implications.
Therefore, the most likely emotion that Alice would feel in this situation is embarrassment, as she is aware of the potential embarrassment that John may feel if Mark's comment is taken as a criticism of John's artistic abilities.

- Alice's silence and knowing glance suggest that she is aware of John's feelings about Mark's comment and is trying to avoid hurting his feelings.

Step 3: Determine the emotion(s) that Alice would feel in this situation.

Next, we need to consider the emotions that Tom might feel in this situation. The question asks why Tom would feel these emotions.
(a) He is looking forward to marry Janice: This choice doesn't make sense because Tom is planning to break up with Janice.
(b) Janice supports his decision for breaking up: This choice doesn't make sense because the scenario doesn't mention anything about Janice supporting Tom's decision.
(c) He doesn't know Janice knows about his cheating: This choice doesn't make sense because the scenario doesn't mention anything about Janice not knowing about Tom's cheating.
(d) He anticipates having joy being with another woman but has to break up with Janice: This choice makes sense because Tom is planning to break up with Janice to be with the other woman, even though he doesn't feel any feelings for Janice.
