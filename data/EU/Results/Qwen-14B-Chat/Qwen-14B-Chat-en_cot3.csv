The scenario describes a situation where Jane's mother is very strict and always undermines her accomplishments at home. However, when other parents are present, she openly talks about Jane's grades and excitedly praises her daughter.

The question asks why Jane would feel certain emotions in this situation. The options are:

(a) She doesn't like the other parents
(b) Her mother only focuses on her accomplishments
(c) Her mother openly discusses her grades with others
(d) Her mother praises her in front of other parents while criticizing her in private

Based on the scenario, we can eliminate option (a) as it is not related to Jane's emotions towards her mother. Option (b) is also not entirely accurate as the scenario mentions that Jane's mother undermines her accomplishments at home.

Option (d) seems to be the most accurate as it describes a situation where Jane's mother praises her in front of other parents while criticizing her in private. This could make Jane feel hurt, confused, and resentful towards her mother.

Step 3: Analyze the choices - Choice (a) suggests that Ayah is annoyed by Marcus' handshake initiative, but there is no evidence in the scenario to support this. Choice (b) suggests that Ayah is showing respect to Marcus despite cultural restrictions on handshaking between unrelated men and women, which is a possible explanation for her behavior.
