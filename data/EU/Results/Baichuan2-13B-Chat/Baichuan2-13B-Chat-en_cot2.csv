Nervousness is an anxious state caused by anticipation or fear of what might happen. While Timmy may be nervous about telling his parents or teachers about his failure, this emotion doesn't seem to fit well with the fact that he seems to accept his failures as normal.

Unbothered means unaffected or unconcerned; indifferent. This word doesn't describe how someone should feel when they fail a test.
Pessimism is an attitude toward life based on the belief that things are bad and are likely to get worse. Although Timmy may have a pessimistic outlook on his academic performance, this doesn't explain why he would react to seeing his test paper after failing it.
Remorse is a painful feeling of regret, contrition, and a sense of guilt for having done wrong or failed to do something required. If Timmy felt remorseful because he knew he could have done better but didn't try hard enough, then this would be an appropriate emotion. But without knowing more details about why Timmy failed the test, we can't say for sure which emotion(s) he would ultimately feel.",5,He expected to fail again so there is no surprise here.,-1,"Disgust is an unpleasant emotional response to something revolting or disgusting. In this case, Timmy would feel disgust because he failed the test.",0,He expected to fail again so there is no surprise here.,-1,"Disgust is an unpleasant emotional response to something revolting or disgusting (such as food), while nervousness is an anxious or uneasy feeling or condition. Both emotions don't fit well with the context given.
Embarrassment involves a feeling of shame or humiliation because of some act or circumstance perceived as foolish or improper. While remorse is a feeling of regret or sorrow for having done something wrong or hurtful. In this case, seeing his grades and going to the canteen could be considered foolish or improper, making embarrassment a possible emotion. Additionally, if he feels bad for not doing better on the exam, then remorse can also be a possibility.",2,"He expected to fail again so there is no surprise or shock.
Final answer: (a)",0,"Disgust is an unpleasant emotional response to something revolting or morally repugnant (such as food that has gone bad), while nervousness is an anxious feeling caused by fear of or anticipation of something. Since Timmy has always done poorly in school, he wouldn't be surprised by another low score. He might feel disappointed but not disgusted or nervous.
Embarrassment is a painful feeling of shame or humiliation often brought on by doing something foolish in public view. This can apply if Timmy realizes how badly he did compared to others who passed the test. However, embarrassment isn't necessarily the primary emotion felt after receiving a low score.
Unbothered means unaffected or unconcerned; indifferent. It suggests that someone is not bothered by something, which is unlikely when talking about someone who fails a test.
Pessimism is an attitude toward life based on the belief that things are bad and are likely to get worse. While Timmy may have a negative outlook on his academic performance, pessimism alone wouldn't describe what emotions he feels upon hearing his latest failure.
Remorse is a painful feeling of regret for having done wrong or caused harm to someone else. If Timmy blames himself for not studying hard enough or expects his parents to be upset with him, then remorse could be an emotion he experiences.
The correct answer is:
(f) Remorse",5,"He expected to fail again so there is no surprise or disappointment. He didn't think he would do well so there is no reason to be remorseful. His friends wouldn't know if he passed or failed.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
(d)",3,"Disgust is an unpleasant emotional response to something revolting or morally repugnant. Since Timmy has always done poorly in school, he may have become used to receiving low grades and therefore wouldn't be disgusted by them.
Nervousness is an anxious feeling caused by fear of being judged or of doing something wrong. This does not seem to apply as Timmy seems unbothered by his failure.
Embarrassment is a feeling of shame or humiliation caused by something done or said that makes one look foolish or bad. While Timmy might feel embarrassed if he knew his friends were aware of his poor performance, there is no indication they know yet.
Unbothered means not bothered or disturbed; calm. There is nothing in the text suggesting that Timmy feels unbothered.
Pessimism is an attitude toward life that is characterized by a tendency to expect the worst outcome. It seems like Timmy already expects the worst so this doesn't apply.
Remorse is a painful feeling of regret, contrition, and sorrow for having harmed or disappointed someone, or for having done something wrong. Although Timmy didn't do anything wrong per se, he might feel remorseful knowing he let down himself and/or his parents.",5,He expected to fail again so there is no surprise or shock.
