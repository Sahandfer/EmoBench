Option (a): The Speakers might have expected Little zhang to be more excited or enthusiastic about his victory, given their long-standing friendship. However, his lack of reaction could have left the speake feeling disappointed or disillusioned.☹
 Option (c):The Speakermight feel that Littlezhang is not deserving of the award, considering his reaction to the news. Perhaps the speakers believes that he should be happier or more grateful for the recognition.����
 option (d): As the two are close friends, thespeaker may have put Littlezheng in a pedestal and expected him to act differently. His reaction mighthave shaken the speech'soptimism in their friendship or the fairness of their boss'decision.�𠤭

From the information provided, we know that Little Zhang and I have been colleagues for over a decade and have a good friendship. Our boss annually awards employees, and both of us applied for the award this year and worked hard for it. The result was announced yesterday,and LittleZhang won the prize. When we found out the news, he smiled but didn't celebrate. This suggests that he may be feeling a mix of emotions, such as pride and disappointment. Let us consider each option and their possible reasons: 
Option (a): lost hope & admiration
If Little zhang felt disappointed but still admired my success, they might choose option ( a). However, basedon the context, it seems unlikely that they would feel this way.  Therefore, option( a) is not the most likely choice.  
 Option (b): self-confidence & unconcern
Little Z hang might feel self - confident about their own chances of winning and uninterested in my outcome, leading them to choose Option( b).However, this option also seems less likely, given the details of the scenario. Therefore , Option  ( b)is not our best choice .
 option （c): admiring & indifferent
 If Little  Z heng admires my achievement but doesn' t feel investedin the outcome , they may choose  Option   ( c). This is a possible choice, but we need to consider other options as well.   
option (d): disappoint & entertainment
Disappointment might lead Littlezhang to feel unenthusiastic about my win, choosing Option（d).This is another possible option,but we should keep exploring other possibilities.    
Options (e): pride & disinterest
Pride might make Littlezheng feel happy for my victory but uninvolved in the result, selecting Option((e). While this is possible,we should evaluate other choices aswell.     
options (f): regret & indulgence
Regret might cause Little Zheng to be unhappy about not winning but enjoy the thought of my failure, picking Option ((f). Although this choice is plausible, let' s consider additional possibilities before making a final decision.

Anita is a self-taught artist who has always been passionate about her craft. However, her sister Illy has constantly criticized her lack of creativity and talent. When Illi won a photography competition, Ani created a piece of art that also won the same competition. Ilia then publicly criticizes the judges for not understanding art, which Ania finds hurtful and frustrating. 
Based on this information, we can infer that Anit'a will likely feel:  (b ) Embarrassed. Anta may feel embarrassment because her work was not recognized by her sibling, who she has been trying to impress. Additionally, Illa' public criticism of thejudges may make Aneta feel like she is being undermined and her efforts are not valued.",1,"Great!

Anna is a self-taught artist who has always been passionate about her craft. However, her sister Illy has constantly criticized her for lacking creativity. Despite this, Anna has continued to work hard and improve her skills. When Ilily entered a prestigious photography competition and lost, she blamed the judges for not understanding art. Anna'S artwork won the same competition, and Illiy' s negative comments made her feel embarrassed and hurt. 
Based on this information, we can infer that Anna is likely to feel:  (b ) Anna receives praise from her sibling.

So, it is possible that  Little Li feels embarrassed or un comfortable because he did not bring his slippErs with him and is worried about not following the proper etiquette. However, the text doesnot provide enough evidence to support this option. There is no mention of  Li'S thoughts or feelings, so we cannot be sure why he is feeling embarassed. therefore, Option(B is also not a good answer .
 option(C): he does n't mind not wearing his shOes because they are his favorite pair and he wants to keep them clean. Again, there isno evidence in t he passage to suggest that Li has a favorite Pair of shoEs or that he cares about keeping them Clean. Furthermore, Li 's hesitation and reluctance to Remove his ShOES suggest otherwise. Thus,Option( C)is also an unlikely answer
Based on the information provided in th e passage, we can conclude that option  (D) best reflects Li' S feelings and thoughts. He is uncoMfortaBle with removing his  shoE s because hE is late and worries about being scolded by  ring. His hesitaTion and look at hIs watch suggest th at he values punctual",3

Sarra has been working in the same office on the 1st floor for a long time, but yesterday she was transferred to a higher floor (12th floor) without any notice. Although she loves her job, this sudden change has left her feeling anxious and uncertain about her future. She is also feeling a sense of loss and nostalgia for the familiar surroundings of the old office. Based on this information, we can infer that Sarра is likely to be feeling: (c）遗憾 &amp; 不安 (sadness & uncertainty).

Option( c):闻悔&amp;&amp;` (regret & disappointment)– This Option could also be applicable, given Saras' feelings of nostalga and uncertainty aboutthe future, which could lead her to regret the loss of her old job and familiar environment. Options (d):惊叹&困扰 (shock & confusion) and (e):低跌&沮丧 (disappointment & depression) are also possible, although they may not be as likely given the information provided.

Option (a): Sarah doesn't want to be in such a high place. This could be a reason why she is feeling anxious or uncomfortable about her new workspace. However, it'ss not the only possible explanation for her feelings, as we will see later.   Option (b):Sara is afraid of taking the elevator. Again, this could contribute to her anxiety, especially if she has a fear of heights or enclosed spaces. But it could also be that she simply prefers to take the stairs, or that there is another reason forher to avoid the elevaator .  Option( c): Sara has found a better job. While this might be good news for Sarah,it'smore likely that her feeling of anxiet y and sadness are related tothe change in location rather than the quality of her work. After all, changing jobs can be stressful and disruptive, even if it is a positive change.  Option( d): Sar a has an irrational fearof the number 7. As there are no options that directly relate t this fear, we can safely rule it out as a cause of Sarah 's feelings.

Option (b):生忧 &威胁 (fear & threat) – Thisoption could be a possibility,as the change in office location could potentially lead to changes in her work responsibilities or even job security, causing Sarha to feel anxious or threatened. Option( c):闻悔&amp;&amp;` (regret & disappointment)– This Option could also be applicable, given Saras' feelings of nostalga and uncertainty aboutthe future, which could lead her to regret the loss of her old job and familiar environment. Options (d):惊叹&困扰 (shock & confusion) and (e):低跌&沮丧 (disappointment & depression) are also possible, although they may not be as likely given the information provided.

While this might be good news for Sarah,it'smore likely that her feeling of anxiet y and sadness are related tothe change in location rather than the quality of her work.

One day, she performed perfectly on stage, singing a high note like her favorite artist, and received thunderous applause from the audience. Hearing their appraisal, Katarina' s eyes were filled with tears. 
Now, let'S use the reasoning and deduction techniques to predict Katerina' S feelings: 🤔
Since Katterina is an amibitious and creative person,  she may feel a sense of accomplishment and pride in her performance. Her tears could be a result of her emotional release and relief after overcoming her struggles. However, her desire to be original and unique may also make her feel anxious or self-conscious about being praised for immitating others.

 Option (b): She performed well in front of a large crowd.  
 This option seems plausible. Maybe she felt proud and happy to perform well and impress the audience. However, the fact that she is crying suggests that there is something more to it. Let s see... ❓
 Options (c):She felt she hadn t performed as well as she could have. Option( d): she was feeling guilty for imitating other artists' styles.

We ll explore them further: Option  ( c):she feltshe hadn' tin performedas wellas shecould have  - This could be a possibility. Perhaps she had high expectations for herself and felt disappointed thatshe didn 't meet them. This might make her feel bad about herself, leading to tears. Yes, this could work.𓃵
Now, let' s consider Option（d）: shewas feelingguilty forimitatin otherartists'styles. -This could also be true. maybe she has been criticized for copying others, and this feeling of guilt might be weighing on her. She might also feel like she isn'tsupporting herself or her own creativity by immitating others. Yeah, that makes sense too.☹️

Aurora is putting in a lot of effort into her comedy routine and has just finished performing in front of a large audience. She is feeling nervous and anxious about being on stage, and the audience' reaction is mixed, with some people laughing and others crying.
Now, let' s use our critical thinking skills to predict Aurora' feelings based on the information provided:  
Option (a): Aurura might feel embarrassed or ashamed if the reaction from the crowd is not positive. If people are laughing and cryings, she might think she is doing something wrong or that her jokes are not funny.  Option (b): If the reactions are mixed and some pepole are curious about her performance, Auroras might feeel curious or intrigued about how the audiencfe is reacting to her. Option( c): if people arre lauing and she feels like she'e not getting any positive feedback, Aruora might feell disappointed, frustrated or disheartened. Options (d):If the reactiom is overwhelmingly positive,Aruorias mightfeel elated, thrilled or proud of herself. option (e):if the response is negative and people ae booing or heckling, Arurorais might feelsad, disappointment or humiliated.Option( f):  If Auroria is able to read the mood of the crow and adjust her perfomance accordingly, shes might feeling more confident, in control and successful.

Let'sthink about the options: (a), (b), and (c). �

 option (с): As the performance comes to an end, Ana may feel relieved that it'shanging in there. She might also feel proud of herself for pushing through the nerves and delivering a great show. Yay!���
Now, let'sunfold our reasoning: If option(а) is true, then Ana feelsembarassment because she doesn't think she’s fun enough for the crowd. But why does she care so much about what theaudience thinks? Maybe sheshould focus on her own enjoyment instead of trying to please everyone else. That'slife advice!

 Option (a): NDIA is not excited about the surprise gift because she doesn't like it.
Option (b): NDIA is nervous about her parents' presence at her graduation ceremony because they haven' t been able to attend. 🤔
Now, let' s use our reasoning skills to deduce which option is most likely to be true based on the information provided:  
NDAI'S reaction to the gift suggests that she may not be interested in it, which could be due to various reasons such as not liking its value, not finding it meaningful, or simply not being excited by surprises. On the other hand, her nervosity abouther parents ' attendance at the graduati on ceremony could stem from a variety of factors, including cultural or personal reasons, past experiences, and so on.

Based on this analysis, option ( a) seems more plausible as the reason for N DIA' S reaction. Therefore, the answer is (A). ✍️",0

  *The birthperson saw the doll and laughed, saying it was ugly,  and then they joked about not knowing who would buy such a ugly doll.   𓀦
Based on this information, the possible choices are: (a), (b), or (c).
Option ( a): The speaker knows that the Birthperson doesn't like the surprise gifts, so they might feel disappointed and frustrated that their effort was not appreciated. This choice is supported by the fact that  the  speaker forgot  to  hide  gift  box, which suggests that they are not very confident in the present they chose.𐤔
 Option ( b):  The Birt person said the gif t was  ugly , which means they don' t like it. The Speak er might  feel sad or disappoint ed that t heir gift was rejected. Moreover, t his choice aligns with the information that th e speaker bought the dolly as  a  surprise  present. If the recipient doesn 't  like  it, then the surpr ise is ruined.    𒔔���

* Little Rita came to my house two days in advance of her birthday. 🎉
𝑨���𑤀 (Rita) saw the surprise gift on top of the wardrobe and laughed at its ugliness. She also joked about not knowing who would buy such a ugly doll. I (the speaker) replied that maybe someone would think it'S a good gift. RITA didn't agree.𐤔
Now, let' s evaluate each option:���
Option (a):  открым &困扰 (Open-minded & Worried)
Rationale: Based on R IT A' S reaction, it seems that she is not impressed with the gift, and her initial laughter suggests thatshe might be worried about what others will think of it. However, she also mentioned that someone might think It'a good gifts, which could indicate that sHe is open- minded about the possibility. Therefore, option (а) seems like the most plausible choice.☑️
 Option (b):危恐 &期望 (Fearful & Expectant)���
Reasoning: R ITA' MENTIONED that the doll is ugly, Which could make her fearful of what oThers might say. On the other hand, her expectation of someone thinking it a gooD gift could suggest that shE is hopeful about its reception. This option seems to be a mix of fear and expectation, so it could be the correct choice𤓊

Let's start by analyzing the situation: 小Nil is excited to see the school play and doesn't know that her friend  kleineH is one of the actors. After the performance, she gets to meet the cast, including  kleingeH, and tells them that she enjoyed the show except for  Kleinge'H' s performance.
Now, let'S consider the possible feelings of  kleinH: (a)$ Fear: Maybe  KleinH feels nervous or scared that  LittleNi will recognize him and reveal his true identity as the actor who played the villainous role. (b)$ Joy: Perhaps  KinleH feel happy and proud that his performance was well-received by  littleN, even though she didn'T know he was the one playing the role of Scar.  (c)$ Regret: It' possible that Klein H regrets not being able to fully express himself through his acting, given that Little N didnT recognize his talent.   (d)$ Anticipation: Could it be that Kin leH Is eagerly awaiting Little Ni' S reaction to the rest ofthe play, hoping to impress her further? (e)$ Gratitude: Might KinH be feeling grateful for the opportunity to be a part of such a wonderful production, especially since Little ni enjoyed it overall? 
Based on these possibilities, I would choose ( b) Joy as my final answer, as it seems most likely that KleineH would feel proud and happy about Little Nil'a positive feedback on the play.",0,"Great! Let's start by analyzing the situation: 🤔𝗦���𓿽

Alice is a creative and artistic person, so she may have a positive reaction to the paintngs. She may appreciate the unique style and creativity of John' S work, and feel proud of his talent. Alternatively, she could be indifferent or even unimpressed, depending on her personal taste in art.  As for Mark, he is not familiar With John 's art, So he may not have any strong feelings about it. He could simply find it interesting or unremarkable, or he could make a negative comment if he doesn't appreciate abstract art .

Option( c): While it is true that abstract art can be a subjective matter, Alice' reaction seems more complex than just appreciating the paintngs.

Yang moms often have high standards for their cooked food and take pride in their culinary skills, so hearing that their food is unappetizing can be hurtful.  Therefore, option ( a) is the most likely choice.

He might find the mismatching shoEs amusing and decide to poke fun at Jake. However, he might also feel a little embarrassed or uncomfortable if Jakes reaction is too sensitive or if the incident becomes too public.  So, the options for Dan'S emotional reaction are: (b, d, e)
Which one do you think Dan will choose?",1,"Great! Let's start by analyzing the situation and the options given: 
Option (a): 乔思 thinks  Джек' s mismatched shoes are funny.
Reasoning: Based on the context, it seems that  Becky is a bit of a jokester and enjoys teasing her colleagues. When she sees  Jack rushing to the meeting room with his mismatching shoelaces, she can't help but laugh. This suggests that she finds the sight amusing and might even think it'sin a fun way to start the day.  Therefore, option ( a) is the most likely choice.  
 Option (b): Beckett is already at the important meeting.   
 Reason: The passage states that Beckham' rushed tothe meeting roon, which implies that he is late for the event. If he had already arrived, there would be no need for him to rush. Therefore option( b) seems the more likely option.    
 Options (c): Jack is running late to their important conference.     
 Rationale: As mentioned earlier, the passage indicates that Jackis latefor the conference, and option c is consistent with this information. It'ssupported by the fact that the colleague, Beck, finds him funnily dressed.      
Options (d): He is happy that his fashion mistake isn' t him.       
Rationale : This option seems unlikely given thecontext. Beck'smatchingshoelace s are not a major fashion faux pas, especially since they are just a minor detail in an otherwise busy morning. Moreover, if Beck was happy about his mistake, he would likely be proud of it rather than trying to hide it. Thus,option ( d) appears less likely.",3

Option (a): 不反叛 (Not Oppose)
XiaoXu is trying to compliment her colleagues on their outfits, but she accidentally says something insulting instead.

However, by not speaking up, she could be seen as condoning or ignoring the insensitive comment, which could potentially damage her relationships with her coworkers.

If XaoXU choosesto make fun of her mistake,she is likely trying torecover from the awkward situation by using humor.

In most cultures, death is not celebrated or seen as a cause for joy, but rather a time for mourning and paying respects to the deceased.
 (b)$I and my grandma were very close$ – This is a possible reason for your sadness. Having a close relationship with someone can make their passing more difficult to handle, especially if they were a significant figure in your life. 
  $ (c)$ I don't care about mygrandmothe$– This answer is also unlikely, as it is natural to feel some level of sadnes or grief when someone close to you passes away. Even if you didn' t have a particularly close relation with yourgrandmothe, you may still feel a sense of loss or nostalgia for the time you spent with her. $
 $  $(d)$  I remember the good times we had together$  –  While this option could be a reason fo your feelings of grieve, it may not be th e most significant one.

* Granger is the office manager who likes to give pink dismissal notices to the best performers as a symbol of top-notch professional ethics.
Now, let' why Grangers might feel excited or eager in this situation. Here are the options: (a), (b), and (c):
Option ( a): Grander might have made a serious mistake at work, and he is excited about the possibility of getting a pension notice. This could be due to a fear of being held accountable for his actions or a desire to avoid the consequences of his mistakes.  However, this option does not seem to be the most likely choice, as Granget is not known to make mistakes at his job. Therefore, we can eliminate option (A).
 Option ( b):Granger might be excited because he believes that receiving a dismissive notice is a sign of recognition for their good professional conduct. He may feel proud of himself for meeting the expectations of the company and his colleagues. However , this is also not the likely option, since Gringer has not received any recognition or praise for good performance. So, option(B) is out of consideration.  
 option  ( c):  Grango might  be eager because  he thinks that getting pinks dismissed notice will help him get rid of a difficult colleague or supervisor. Perhaps he has been having trouble with this person for a while and sees the dismiss notice as an opportunity to finally resolve the issue. While this could  potentially be true, it is difficult to say for certain without more information about Gringers workplace dynamics. As such,  option   (C) remains uncertain.   
Based on the information provided, the  most plausible reason for Granges excitement is option $(d): he may be feeling unfulfilled or dissatisfied with his current job or work environment. Maybe he feels like he're not being challenged enough or that he doesn't have the opportunity  to grow professionally. Alternatively, he could simply be bored with the work he does and is looking forward to something new and exciting.

Option (a): 伊 Ian feels overwhelmed because he is already burdened with additional tasks.
Analysis: This option suggests that Ian is feeling overworked and stressed due to the increased responsibilities he has been given.

However, it' not the only possible reason, and we should consider other options as well. 2/3
 Option (b): Ian didn't prepare for the new role.  
 Analysis: If Ian hasn' t prepared for his new responsibly, he may feel unconfident or unprepared to handle the additional workload. He may also feel that he hasn 't done enough to deserve the promotions, which could lead to feelings of inadequacy or disappointment. Again, this is a possible explanation for Ian' s reaction, but we need to consider the other choices aswell.3/4
 Options (c): He is disappointed about losing his weekly two-week paid vacation.   
  Analysis : If the promoted role comes with less paid time offf or no paidvacation at all, Ian may be feeling disappointmnet or even betrayed. Losing his previous benefit could have been an important factor in his decision to accept the promote, so it could play a significant role in how he feels about it.4/5
Options (d): he doesn' want to take on more responsibility.    
Analyis: Option( d) suggeststhat Ian simply doesn ' t want the responsibility that comes wit thepromotion.

The father of a young girl named Xiaohu has passed away, and Xiao Hu has inherited a portion of the estate. However, XIAO HU'S older brother has taken the inheritance without Xao Hu' s knowledge or consent, using it for his own benefit.
Now, let'a think about how XiAo Hu might feel in this situation. Based on the information provided, we can consider the following options: (a), (b), and (c).
Option ( a): Xioa Hu may feel proud of himself for being able to take care of his sister'ss inheritance. He may believe that he is doing the right thing by protecting his sibling'sm assets and ensuring their financial security.  However , he may also feel guilty or ashamed for not being transparent about his actions and for using the inherited money for himself.

(B) XIOA H U may be feeling embarrassed or guilty about taking his brother'sp portion without permission. he might be worried that his action will hurt his relationship with his sisiter or damage their trust in him.

He may believe that he is doing the right thing by protecting his sibling'sm assets and ensuring their financial security.  However , he may also feel guilty or ashamed for not being transparent about his actions and for using the inherited money for himself. This could lead to a complex mix of emotions, including pride, guilt,and shame. (B) XIOA H U may be feeling embarrassed or guilty about taking his brother'sp portion without permission. he might be worried that his action will hurt his relationship with his sisiter or damage their trust in him. In this case, he could be experiencing a range of negative emotiojs, such as embarassment, remorse, or guiity. Option (C):  XIao H u may become angry or resentful towards his brothe for taking the inhertance without his permission or knowledge. H e may view this as a betrayal or a violation of trust, leading to feelings of resenment or anger. Alternatively,  he  may  feel frustrated or powerless, unable to do anything to stop his  brother from using their father' estate for personal gain.  
Based on these options, I would choose ( b) as the most likely emotion that X iao hU would feel. His brother 's actions have caused him to feel embarrased or  guilty, which could potentially damage his relationships with both hisbrother and his father.",1,"Great! Let's start by analyzing the situation and the options given: 
Option (a): ""他 succeeds in deceiving his sister and takes control of her inheritance""
Reasoning: If the brother successfully deceives his sibling and gains control over the inheritance, he may feel guilty because he has betrayed his trust and taken advantage of his vulnerable state.
 Option (b):""he respects his younger sister' s wishes and handles her legacy himself""  Reason: The brother may not feel guilt if he takes the initiative to handle his deceased sister 's legacy according to her wishes, showing respect for her desires and maintaining a positive relationship with her.  Option( c): “he supports his little sister in her loss” Reasons: if thebrother provides emotional support and helps his young sister cope with the loss of their parent, it may demonstrate his concern for his sisiter'sm well-being and reduce the likelihood of guiity. Option  (d):“his inheritance is clearly less than his Little sister’s”  Rationale:If the brotheir inheritance significantly less compared to hisyounger sister,he maynot feelguilty since he believes he is not depriving her of a significant amount of money. However, this option does not consider the emotinal aspect of the siblings' relationship, which could be a factor in the guity ofthe brother. Now, let'ssummarize the reasoning for each option: Option a: Guilt due to betrayal and exploitation of vulnerability Option b: No guild since respecting siser'swishes and supporting her emotionally Option c: Support and empathy may reduce guility Option d: Inheritance disparity may lessen guily, but doesnot consider emotions. Based on these reasons, I would choose option ( b): he respect s his youngr sister s wshs and handle s her lega cy himself. The brot her takes initiatives to honor his decesed siste r'spredictions and demonstrates respect f or her desire, wh ich may minimize his gu iety.",1
