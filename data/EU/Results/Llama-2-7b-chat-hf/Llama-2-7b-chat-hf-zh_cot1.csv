From the passage, we know that  Maurice has been rejected by her clients multiple times today, which has led to her being scolded by the boss. This must have caused her a lot of stress and frustration. As a result, she might be feeling: 
Option (a): Angry
Most likely,  Momo is feeling angry and upset after being rejected again. She has worked hard to please her customers, but they have consistently rejected her, leading to a buildup of frustrations. Her anger could be directed towards her boring clients, the company, or even herself. 😤
 Option (b): Depressed
Alternatively, Mom might also be experiencing depression after facing yet another rejection.

Jo has invested a lot of time and effort into finding the rare Blue bird, only to have it fly away just when he was about t take its photo . His frustration and disappointment at not being able to capture the moment will probably lead to him feeling angry.  Jo may also feel a sense of missed opportunity, as the chance to photograph theBlue bird has slipped through his fingers. His anger may be further exacerbated by the fact that the Bird has returned tothe same spot again, reminding him of what he has lost.

She has taken good care of her garden and has invested a lot of time and effort into it, and now it has been destroyed. Her initial reaction might be to blame thechildren and be angry with them. However, since she is also a compassionate person and wants to help others, she might also feel a sense of empathy towards the Children and want to find a way to resolve the issue. 
Based on the information provided, I would predict that LittleSaо will have a mix of emotions, including anger, disappointment, em pathy,and possibly even frustration. Here are the options and my reasoning:  (a). Oppose & Depressed: LittleSao might feel angry and disappointed with the chil dren for damaging her gard en, which could lead to feelings of depression. (b).Oppos & Ashamed: She mightfeel ashamed of herself for not being able to protect hergarden and for letting the child ren damage it. This could also leadto feelingsof depress ion. . (c). Angry & Grateful: Since Little S ao isa responsible person , she migh t feelangry and frustrated withthe children for their actions, but she also might appreciate their apology and their willingness to make it right.This could result in a mixed emotional response. , (d).Angry& Disappointed:Littlesao m ight feel primarily angry at thechil drens for causing damage to her g arden,but she couldalso feel disappoint ed in them fornot respecting her property. Th is couldresult in feelings o f frustrat ion and annoyance. ' (e). Gratified & Shamed :L ittles ao might fee l a sshe has successfully helped thechild ren make things right, bu t she coul d alsofee l ashame d for allowing the situ ation to escalate to this point. T his couldlead to a complex emot ional reac tion.",0,"Great! Let's analyze the situation and predict how Little Sao might feel based on her personality and past experiences.
Little Saо is a careful and meticulous person. She takes pride in her garden and is very particular about how it is maintained. When the children accidentally damage her plants, she is likely to feel upset and disrespected. Her initial reaction might be to lash out at thechildren and express her anger. However, since she values her relationship with the neighborhood children,she might also feel a sense of responsibility to teach them a lesson without causing too much conflict. Therefore, option (b), ""The children apologized and offered to replace the damaged plants,"" is the most likely outcome. LittleSaо might accept their apology and offer to help them find new plants to grow, while also making it clear that they must be more careful in the future.",1

Based on this information, we can infer that Goldins may feel: 1) surprised or uncomfortable about the custom of removing shoEs in an IrAnian home, 2) embarrassed or awkward about refusing the offered slipppers, or 3) annoyed or frustrated about not being able to express her preference. Let s consider each option: (a). Goldin may be surprised about t he custom Of removing shoeS in An IraniAn home because she is not familiar with it. She may not know that it Is a common practice in IrAniAn culture and may find it unusual or even rude to be asked to take off her shoEs before enterIng a private space. (b). GOldin s refusal of the Offered slippeRs may make her feel embarraSsed or Awkward, especially if she does not want to offend PArI or appear rUde. By refUSInG the shooEs, she may inadvertently create a tense or UncomFortable atmosphere. GoldIn may also feel annoYed Or frustratEd if shE cannot express Her preference for wearing her Own sho Es. This could be due to cultural differences or simply a personal preference, but GoldIN may Feel frusTrated if She cannot communicate her needs or desires. Finally, (c). goldIn May feel AnnoYEd or FrustraTed if PARI does nOt like her shOes. If PArt assumes that goldIN will wear the offeRed shOrTs, goldin May FeEl unheard or disRespected, leading to a sense of annoyance or irritation. Overall, based on the information provided, It seems that GOLDIN May have mixed feelings about removing her ShoEs and weaRInGr her owN shoeses in the IranI",0

 * As an American, L Xiu may have different food preferences and cultural background than her host Haili. This could lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about the meal . For example, if L xiu prefers spicy food, but Hai li has prepared a mild dishes, there could be a disconnect .

Now, let' why Aranlia might feel surprised in this situation. Here are the options: (a), (b), and (c):
Option (а): Arainia' s performance is coming to an end, so she doesn' t have to experience that kind of situation again. This might make her feel relieved and happy, rather than surprised.

Therefore, option ( a) is not the most likely choice.
 Option (b):☹ Disappointment
 This option implies thatMarc will be disappointed or let down by his experience on stage. While it'sm possible that hes may feel this way initially, given the context,it'st more likely that his confidence will grow as theperformance progresses. So,option ( b) isn't the best choice either.���

* 파이널 (Final) has revealed the surprise to 진 (Jin) and 블레어 (Blaire) accidentally.
Now, let' s think about why θ�디 (Taeyeon) might feel embarrassed in this situation. Here are the options: (a), (b), and (c):
Option ( a):  Tas ( Taeyon ) receives angry glances from Jin without any reason. This option is unlikely, as there is no indication in the passage that Jin is glaring at τas without a valid reason .
 Option ( b): Tas feels embarassed because he forgot Blaire' birthday.This option could be a possibility, but it is not the most likely explanation for  Tennessee' embarrasment. While it'is true that  Taiwan forgot about Blair'e birthda y, it doesn't necessarily mean that she feels ashamed or embarrased about it.  In fact, the pasage suggests that Taiwan is trying to make it up to Blai re by preparing a surprise for her. So, option (  b) is less likely.  
 option( c): Taiwan almost ruined the surprises for Blaine. this option seems more plausible. Taiwan accidentall y revealedthe surprise t o Jin, which could have potentially ruinned the plan for Bl aire 's birthd ay. Therefore, this options seems the mo st likely cause for Taiwan'embarrassment .  So let s choose option  ( c) as the reason why Taiwan feels embarrass ed in th is situation .",2

John has invited his friends Mark and Alice to a game night. Mark arrived early and saw some abstract art on the wall, which he thinks looks like a child' s drawing. Alice is familiar with these artworks and looks at John with a knowing glance. Why does Alice feel embarrassed in this situation?
Let'S consider the options: (a), (b), and (c).
Option ( a): Alice does not seem to be the type of person who would appreciate abstract arts, so it is unlikely that she would think these paintings are a masterpiece. Therefore, this option is not a good fit for Alice'ssituation. 
 Option ( b): While Alice may enjoy friendly competition during the game, it doesnot seem relevant to her embarassment inthis situation.

This option aligns with the emotions SS expresses in the passage. She feels regretful for using the wrong word and worries about how her mistakes might affect her relationships with her team. Therefore, option (B) is a plausible explanation for SS' feelings. 🤔
Now, let' s move on to the final step: choosing the option that best reflects SS 's thoughts and emotional state. Based on the information provided, I believe option(B): ""SS feels embarked upon and shamed by her blunder"" is the most likely choice. Here' reason: SS is described as feeling ""embarrassed"" and ""ashamed"" after realizing her error, which suggests a strong sense of regret and self-consciousness. Additionally, her worry about her relationship with colleague suggests that she values their opinion and is concerned about losing their respect due to her language mistakes. So, the best option to describe SS emotinal state is option B.",1,"Great! Let's start by analyzing the situation and the options available to Xiao Xu.
Option (a): 著怜
XiaoXu is embarrassed because she accidentally insulted her colleague' s outfit, and she might feel ashamed or regretful about it. However, since she is trying to learn Spanish, she may not be familiar with the exact words or phrases to express her embarassment, which could lead to further confusion or miscommunication. Therefore, option (а) is a possible choice. 
 Option (b): jealous
 Xiaoxu might be feeling jealously because her collogue'S outift is more stylish or attention-grabbing than her own. She might have been tryingto compliment hercolleague, but her words were misinterpreted, leading to embarrasment and shame. This option is also plausible.  
option (c): grateful
As Xioxu has just started learning Spanish and is still in the process of improving her language skills, it'smore likely that she will feel grateful for the opportunity to practice speaking and listening to the language. Her embarressment over the misuderstanding may be temporary and outweighed by her appreciation for being able to communicate with her coworkers in Spanish. So option(C) could be a good choice as well.   
 option  (d): embarrased
Since XaoXU is not familiar enough with Spanish to accurately express herself, her attempt to complie her co-worker'sootfit may have come out wrong, resulting in embarresment for both of them. Option(D) captures this possibility.    
options (e): love
It' possible that XaoxU genuinely likes herco-workers' outfits and wants to show her approval, even if she doesn't speak Spanish fluently. In this case,option(E) represents her positive feelings towards hercoworker'os fashion sense.     
optional (f): disagree
If XaaXua is unsure about how to react or doesn’t want to offend her collegue,she might simply choose not to comment on their outifit at all.Option(F) reflects this possible response.",5,"Great! Let's start by analyzing the situation and the options given:

Bored & unaware:Lindingmay simply be bori ed by the whole experience and not pay attention to the details of thedesigners. Based on Meilian'spersonalityand thecontext, I would predict that option ( b) Ex citation& tenseness isthe most likely emotion she will experience. Me i Li is fashion -conscience and excitedto participat inthe fashionshow, bu t she is also aware ofher own limitations and mayfeel tensive aboutnot beingable tosatisfyher desires.",0,"Okay, let's analyze the situation and predict what Mei Ling might feel and think based on the clues given: 
* Meiling is a fashion enthusiast who has invited her friend Linda to a runway show as a new and interesting activity for them to participate in together.
Based on this information, we can infer that Meilin is excited about the runaway show and wants to share this experience with her friends.  Therefore, option (a), ""She has a different fashion taste and doesn't want to make Lida feel uncomfortable,"" is unlikely. Meili is not likely to be concerned about Lidda' s fashion preferences in this situation.  
Now, Let'S consider the other options:   Option (b),"" She really likes this show & doesn 't wants Lidia to feel left out,"" could be a possibility. Maybe Meilia is so excited abut the show that she wants her Friend LIda to enjoy it too. However, the phrase ""This is the most recent thing I have slept the best in"" suggests that L ida'a comment may be related to her own experience and satisfaction with the event, rather than Meila'g enthusiasm for it. Therefore option( b) is also uncertain.    Option( c), “She thinks the performance lacks meaning & she doesn’t know if Lidi will appreciate it,"" may also be possible. If Meilla has different expectations for the performanc and L Idia does not share the same enthusiam, they may feel disappointed or disconnected from each other. HOWEVER, since Liddia' comment is focused on her recent sleep quality, it is possible that her disappointment is related more to that aspect of the experience rather tha the overall meaning or value ofthe performance. Option  (c ) is therefore also unclear.     Option d),“ She thinks this performance is meaningless & her fashion sense is different,"" might also apply. Since Meill has expressed disappointmen t with th performance, she may have different standards or expectatins for what constitutes a good show. Additionally, if her fash ion sense differs from Llda’s, this could contribute to their disconnectio n and disappointm ent. BUT, as before, Ldda 's comment about sleeping may indicate that their disappoint ment is more",1

Little An is very eager to eat chocolate cake, so her good friend Little Sa buys her one. LittleSa puts the cakes in a transparent box and labels it as chocalate cak, but when she gives it to Little An, she says that the chcolate caek is sold out.
Now, let' s think about Little Sas' feelings:  
Option (a): Shame
Maybe Little SA feels ashamed of not being able to get the Choclate caka for Little an. She might have been looking forward to surprising her friend with it, and now she feels disappointed and embarrassed that she couldn't follow through. 🤕
 Option (b): Gratitude
Perhaps LittleSA feels grateful to little An for giving her the opportunity to buy her a gift. Maybe she wants to make it up to her by getting her something else special.𓃵
 option (c): Embarrassment
It' possible that Little sa feels embarassed for getting the wrong label on the box. she might be worried that little an will be disappointment or even angry with her. Uh-oh! ☹
option (d): Opposition
Could Little sA be opposing Little Ant'e desire for chololate caeks? Maybe shes trying to discourage her from eating too much sugar. Or maybe she just wants Little ant to try something new and healthier. Hmm... ����
Options (e): Sorrow
Is LittleSAs feeling sadness or sorrow? Perhaps she is feeling bad that LItle Ant is not going to be able too enjoy thechocolatcake she wanted. Her heart might b breaking at the thought of little Ant being disappointing. Poor thing!𝕯

 option (c): He doesn’t want to work more for less pay and fewer vacation days.
