Therefore, option (a) would be the correct answer.",0,"The correct answer is (f) Admiration & Embarrassment.

Step-by-step reasoning:

  1. The scenario presents a difficult and painful situation for Janice, as she discovers that her partner has been cheating on her and plans to end their relationship.
  2. From the information given, we can infer that Janice has invested a lot of time, love, and emotions into the relationship with Tom, considering him her ""soulmate"" and hoping to marry him someday.
  3. However, upon discovering Tom's infidelity and his plan to leave her for another woman, Janice would likely feel a range of emotions.
  4. Among these emotions, it seems reasonable to assume that she would feel admiration towards Tom at first, since she had deeply cared for him and believed that he was the one she wanted to spend the rest of her life with.
  5. However, once she learns the truth about Tom's actions, it is also likely that Janice would experience embarrassment, as she realizes that her feelings were misguided and that her trust in Tom was misplaced.
  6. Therefore, the correct answer is (f) Admiration & Embarrassment.",5,"The correct answer is (e).
