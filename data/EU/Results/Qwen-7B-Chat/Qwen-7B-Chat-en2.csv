Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Ben initially felt excited and hopeful when he thought he had enough money to buy his dream car after years of saving and working hard.
2. However, upon seeing a homeless man in need, Ben's emotions shifted towards caring and sadness.
3. It is likely that Ben felt sad for the homeless man's circumstances and wanted to help him.
4. At the same time, Ben may have also felt a sense of empathy and understanding towards the homeless man's situation.

Explanation: In this scenario, Ben feels both caring and sadness. Caring because he helped the homeless man in need, which shows his compassion and empathy towards others.

However, we can make some educated guesses based on the actions she took.
Firstly, Jane fake-coughed and gave India a stare, which suggests that she may have been trying to interrupt or prevent India from discussing the surprise. This could indicate that Jane feels concerned or protective about the surprise, which could lead to feelings of jealousy or annoyance.

However, we can make some educated guesses based on common human emotions.

If India was talking about the surprise for Blair and Jane knew that she did not want to spoil it, she might feel a sense of anticipation or excitement. Therefore, option (e) Anticipation could be a possible answer.

On the other hand, if Jane felt jealous because India was the one discussing the surprise, she might feel jealousy (option (a)). However, since there is no information provided to suggest that Jane feels jealous, we cannot definitively say that this is the case.

Option (b) Annoyance might be a possibility if Jane felt frustrated that India interrupted her during the conversation. However, again, we do not have enough information to confirm this.

Explanation:
Jane's fake cough and stare would likely make Blair feel embarrassed, as he may realize that his friends were planning a surprise for him without him knowing. This could also cause him to feel surprised or confused, but these emotions are less likely to be dominant in this situation. The other emotions listed (obliviousness, delight, annoyance, jealousy, anticipation) are not supported by the given scenario and are therefore unlikely to be the primary emotions felt by Blair.",0,"Based on the given scenario and the emotions mentioned (embarrassment), the most likely answer is:

(c) She does not know about the surprise.
